    <center><h1>Combinatorial Optimization with Prolog</h1></center>
    <br><br>

    Prolog is eminently suitable for solving <b>combinatorial</b> and
    <b>optimization</b> tasks, such as:

    <ul>
      <li>timetabling</li>
      <li>resource allocation</li>
      <li>planning, i.e., finding suitable orderings of dependent
      tasks</li>
      <li>scheduling</li>

      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>

    It is easy to <i>generate&nbsp;and&nbsp;test</i> solutions for
    such tasks in&nbsp;Prolog. If this is done <i>naively</i> (either
    in Prolog or with any other language), then it quickly leads to
    infeasible programs, because there are typically too many
    combinations to generate them&nbsp;all.

    <br><br>

    To efficiently solve combinatorial optimization tasks in many
    cases of practical relevance, Prolog provides a declarative
    solution called <b>constraints</b>. Importantly, constraints
    can <i>prune</i> large parts of the search&nbsp;tree before the
    search even begins, and also while the search is progressing. In
    typical cases, this is vastly more efficient than naively
    enumerating solutions. In addition, constraints retain the
    generality we expect from <i>relations</i>, and so you can use
    constraint-based Prolog programs
    for <i>generating</i>, <i>testing</i> and <i>completing</i>
    solutions of combinatorial tasks.

    <br><br>

    In principle, constraints can be provided by any programming
    language. However, they blend in especially seamlessly
    into <i>logic&nbsp;programming</i> languages like&nbsp;Prolog due
    to their relational nature and built-in search and backtracking
    mechanisms. For this reason, logic programming languages have
    become the most important host languages for constraints, and all
    widely used Prolog&nbsp;systems ship with several libraries or
    built-in predicates for constraint&nbsp;solving.

    <br><br>

    <b>CLP(<i>X</i>)</b> stands for <b>constraint logic
      programming</b> over the <i>domain</i>&nbsp;<i><b>X</b></i>.
      Plain Prolog can be regarded as a&nbsp;CLP(<i>H</i>): Constraint
      logic programming over <i>Herbrand&nbsp;terms</i>,
      with <tt>(=)/2</tt> and <tt>dif/2</tt> as the most important
      constraints that denote, respectively, equality and disequality
    of&nbsp;terms.

    There are dedicated libraries for several important&nbsp;domains.
    Support of these libraries differs between Prolog systems, so
    check your Prolog system's manual for more information.

    <br><br>

    For example, SICStus&nbsp;Prolog ships&nbsp;with:

    <ul>
      <li>CLP(FD) for <b>integers</b></li>
      <li>CLP(B) for <b>Boolean</b> variables</li>
      <li>CLP(Q) for <b>rational numbers</b></li>
      <li>CLP(R) for <b>floating point numbers</b></li>
    </ul>

    In Prolog,
    declarative <a href="clpfd"><b>integer&nbsp;arithmetic</b></a>
    can thus be naturally used for solving combinatorial&nbsp;tasks.

    <br><br>


    Here is an example:

    <br>
    <div class="example">
        A chicken farmer also has some cows for a total
        of <b>30&nbsp;animals</b>, and the animals
        have <b>74&nbsp;legs</b> in&nbsp;all.

        <br><br>

        How many chickens does the
        farmer have?
    </div>
    <br><br>

    Answer:

    <pre>
?- Chickens + Cows #= 30,
   Chickens*2 + Cows*4 #= 74,
   Chickens in 0..sup,
   Cows in 0..sup.
<b>Chickens = 23,
Cows = 7</b>.
    </pre>

    Note that <i>no search</i> was necessary at all. The constraint
    solver has deduced the unique solution of the puzzle
    via <a href="clpfd#propagation"><b>constraint&nbsp;propagation</b></a>.

    <br><br>

    In industrial and academic use, the efficiency of a Prolog
    system's constraint solvers is often an important factor when
    choosing a&nbsp;system. This is because many commercial use cases
    of&nbsp;Prolog also involve combinatorial optimization tasks.

    <br><br>

    Integers are the most relevant domain in practice, because
    all <i>finite</i> domains can be mapped to finite subsets
    of&nbsp;<i>integers</i>. Hence, all finite combinatorial
    optimization tasks can be expressed via CLP(FD)&nbsp;constraints.

    <br><br>
    <center><h2 id="mapcolouring">Example: Map Colouring</h2></center>

    Let us consider <b>map colouring</b>, i.e., the task of assigning
    colours to regions of a&nbsp;<i>map</i> in such a way that no
    adjacent regions are assigned the same&nbsp;colour.

    <br><br>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/map_colouring"><img src="videos/t_map_colouring.png" alt="Map Colouring"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    We can easily map this task to a combinatorial task
    over <i>integers</i>, by using one logical variable for each
    region, and one integer for each&nbsp;colour.

    <br><br>

    For concreteness, let us colour the following map:

    <br><br>


    <center>
      <object data="map.svg" type="image/svg+xml" style="padding:20pt">
      </object>
    </center>

    We shall use the <i>integers</i> 0, 1, 2, ..., to represent
    suitable colours. Moreover, we know from
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">Four
      Colour Theorem</a> that <i>at&nbsp;most</i> 4 colours suffice.

    <br><br>

    The following Prolog program describes the task
    using <a href="clpfd">CLP(FD) constraints</a>:

    <pre>
regions(Rs) :-
        Rs = [A,B,C,D,E,F],
        Rs ins 0..3,
        A #\= B, A #\= C, A #\= D, A #\= F,
        B #\= C, B #\= D,
        C #\= D, C #\= E,
        D #\= E, D #\= F,
        E #\= F.
    </pre>

    Disequality constraints (<tt>(#\=)/2</tt>) are used to state that
    pairs of integers that correspond to adjacent&nbsp;regions must
    be&nbsp;<i>different</i>.

    To obtain concrete <i>solutions</i>, we use <a href="clpfd#labeling"><i>labeling</i></a>:

    <pre>
<b>?- regions(Rs), label(Rs).</b>
Rs = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3] ;
Rs = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3] ;
Rs = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1] ;
etc.
    </pre>

    To obtain more readable solutions, we can relate integers
    to colours. For example:

    <pre>
integer_color(0, red).
integer_color(1, green).
integer_color(2, blue).
integer_color(3, yellow).
    </pre>

    This allows us to query:

    <pre>
?- regions(Rs), label(Rs),
   <b><a href="metapredicates#maplist">maplist</a>(integer_color, Rs, Cs),
   pairs_keys_values(Pairs, [a,b,c,d,e,f], Cs)</b>.
Rs = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1],
Cs = [red, green, blue, yellow, red, green],
<b>Pairs = [a-red, b-green, c-blue, d-yellow, e-red, f-green]</b> ;
Rs = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2],
Cs = [red, green, blue, yellow, red, blue],
<b>Pairs = [a-red, b-green, c-blue, d-yellow, e-red, f-blue]</b> ;
etc.
    </pre>

    These solutions look like this:

    <center>
      <object data="map_solution1.svg" type="image/svg+xml" style="padding:20pt">
      </object>
      <object data="map_solution2.svg" type="image/svg+xml" style="padding:20pt"></object>
    </center>


    The following query shows that <i>at least</i> 4 colours are
    needed in this case:

    <pre>
?- regions(Rs), Rs ins 0..2, label(Rs).
<b>false.</b>
    </pre>

    Major advantages of using CLP(FD) constraints for combinatorial
    tasks include:

    <ul>
      <li><i>compactness</i> and <i>elegance</i> of declarative descriptions</li>
      <li><i>efficiency</i> due to powerful <a href="sorting#pruning"><i>pruning</i></a></li>
      <li>intelligent <a href="clpfd#labeling"><i>labeling strategies</i></a> guided by remaining domains</li>
      <li>availability of <i>global constraints</i> tailored for specific applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    <center><h2 id="graph">Graphs</h2></center>

    <b>Graphs</b> are an extremely important concept in mathematics
    and computer&nbsp;science, and many combinatorial tasks can be
    formulated as problems involving graphs. For example, the
    preceding <a href="#mapcolouring">map&nbsp;colouring</a> task is
    an instance of a more general task
    called <i>graph&nbsp;colouring</i>.

    <br><br>

    We distinguish between <i>directed</i> and <i>undirected</i>
    graphs.

    <center><h3>Directed graphs</h3></center>

    A <i>directed</i> graph consists of:

    <ul>
      <li>a set <i>V</i> of <b>vertices</b></li>
      <li>a set <i>A</i> of <b>arcs</b>, which are directed edges of
        the form <i>v</i>&rightarrow;<i>w</i> (<i>v</i>, <i>w</i>
        &in; <i>V</i>).
      </li>
    </ul>

    In Prolog, there are different ways to represent
    directed&nbsp;graphs. One way to do it is to write down the arcs
    as Prolog&nbsp;<a href="concepts#fact"><i>facts</i></a>:

    <pre>
arc_from_to(a, b).
arc_from_to(b, c).
arc_from_to(a, c).
arc_from_to(c, a).
    </pre>

    Such a representation is called <i>temporal</i>, because solutions
    are iteratively reported <i>on&nbsp;backtracking</i>. This
    representation is very well suited for making large amounts
    of&nbsp;data efficiently accessible. An example use&nbsp;case is a
    set of <i>public&nbsp;transport</i> routes between different
    locations.

    <br><br>

    A typical way to describe <i>paths</i> with such a representation is:

    <pre>
path_from_to(A, A, _) --&gt; [A].
path_from_to(A, B, Visited) --&gt; [A],
        { arc_from_to(A, Next),
          maplist(dif(Next), Visited) },
        path_from_to(Next, B, [A|Visited]).
    </pre>

    We keep track of vertices that have already
    been&nbsp;<i>visited</i> and ensure that any vertex is visited at
    most&nbsp;<i>once</i>.

    <br><br>

    Example queries:

    <pre>
<b>?- phrase(path_from_to(a, c, []), Ps).</b>
Ps = [a, b, c] ;
Ps = [a, c] ;
false.

<b>?- phrase(path_from_to(a, To, []), Ps).</b>
To = a,
Ps = [a] ;
To = b,
Ps = [a, b] ;
etc.
    </pre>


    <br><br>
    
    Using <a href="metapredicates#solutions">all&nbsp;solutions</a>
    predicates, we can convert any temporal representation to
    a <i>spatial</i> representation, i.e., Prolog data&nbsp;structures
    such as&nbsp;<a href="data#list"><i>lists</i></a>:

    <pre>
?- findall(From-To, arc_from_to(From, To), Arcs).
<b>Arcs = [a-b, b-c, a-c, c-a].</b>
    </pre>

    Another example:

    <pre>
?- bagof(To, arc_from_to(From, To), Arcs).
From = a,
<b>Arcs = [b, c] ;</b>
From = b,
<b>Arcs = [c] ;</b>
From = c,
<b>Arcs = [a].</b>
    </pre>

    With these predicates, we can obtain a representation of the graph
    in the form of an <i>adjacency&nbsp;list</i>, where we store which
    vertices are reachable from any given&nbsp;vertex:

    <pre>
?- findall(From-Ls, bagof(To, arc_from_to(From, To), Ls), Is).
<b>Is = [a-[b, c], b-[c], c-[a]].</b>
    </pre>

    In Prolog, this is often a good representation for&nbsp;graphs. We
    can easily turn this into
    an <a href="data#assoc"><i>association&nbsp;list</i></a> of the
    form <i>V&rightarrow;Vs</i> to obtain <i>logarithmic</i> worst
    case (and expected) access time when fetching the
    vertices&nbsp;<i>Vs</i> that are reachable from any given
    vertex&nbsp;<i>V</i>. For utmost efficiency, if your Prolog system
    supports&nbsp;it, you can represent each vertex as a
    Prolog&nbsp;variable, and attach information (including arcs) in
    the form of
    variable&nbsp;<a href="attributedvariables"><i>attributes</i></a>.
    This even allows destructive modifications in&nbsp;O(1). With this
    method, you can for example efficiently compute the <i>strongly
    connected components</i> of a directed&nbsp;graph.
    See <a href="/scc.pl"><b><tt>scc.pl</tt></b></a> for more
    information.

    <br><br>

    Note that <i>isolated</i> vertices do&nbsp;not participate in
    any&nbsp;arc, and so&mdash;at least in&nbsp;general&mdash;we also
    need to represent the&nbsp;vertices separately:

    <pre>
vertices([a,b,c,d]).
    </pre>

    In the adjacency list representation, the isolated
    vertex&nbsp;<tt>d</tt> can be represented as&nbsp;<tt>d-[]</tt>.

    <center><h3>Undirected graphs</h3></center>

    An <i>undirected</i> graph consists of:

    <ul>
      <li>a set <i>N</i> of <b>nodes</b></li>
      <li>a set <i>E</i> of undirected <b>edges</b> of the
        form <i>x</i>&minus;<i>y</i> (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>
        &in; <i>N</i>).</li>
    </ul>


    For example, let us reconsider the <i>map</i> colouring task from
    a graph&nbsp;theoretic perspective. The CLP(FD)&nbsp;formulation
    can be regarded as <i>implicitly</i> describing a&nbsp;graph that
    is induced by the <i>constraints</i> that are stated between the
    variables. We now make that graph available <i>explicitly</i> as a
    Prolog&nbsp;term that represents an <i>undirected</i>&nbsp;graph:

    <pre>
edges([a-b,a-c,a-d,a-f,
       b-c,b-d,
       c-d,c-e,
       d-e,d-f,
       e-f]).

edge(X, Y) :- edges(Es), ( member(X-Y, Es) ; member(Y-X, Es) ).
    </pre>

    Now we can query:

    <pre>
?- bagof(E, edge(N, E), Es).
N = a,
Es = [b, c, d, f] ;
N = b,
Es = [c, d, a] ;
N = c,
Es = [d, e, a, b] ;
N = d,
Es = [e, f, a, b, c] ;
N = e,
Es = [f, c, d] ;
N = f,
Es = [a, d, e].
    </pre>

    An explicit representation is well suited for further analysis of
    the&nbsp;graph.

    <center><h3 id="tree">Trees</h3></center>

    In graph theory, a <b>tree</b> is an undirected graph in which any
    two nodes are connected by exactly <i>one</i>&nbsp;path.
    <br><br>

    In Prolog, trees are of special significance because
    Prolog&nbsp;<a href="data#term">terms</a> naturally correspond
    to&nbsp;trees.

    <br><br>

    For example, we can <i>fairly enumerate</i> binary trees as follows:

    <pre>
tree(nil) --&gt; [].
tree(node(_, Left, Right)) --&gt; [_], tree(Left), tree(Right).
    </pre>

    Sample query:

    <pre>
<b>?- length(Ls, _), phrase(tree(T), Ls)</b>.
Ls = [],
T = nil ;
Ls = [_8284],
T = node(_8296, nil, nil) ;
Ls = [_8284, _8290],
T = node(_8302, nil, node(_8310, nil, nil)) ;
Ls = [_8284, _8290],
T = node(_8302, node(_8310, nil, nil), nil) ;
Ls = [_8284, _8290, _8296],
T = node(_8308, nil, node(_8316, nil, node(_8324, nil, nil))) ;
Ls = [_8284, _8290, _8296],
T = node(_8308, nil, node(_8316, node(_8324, nil, nil), nil)) .
    </pre>

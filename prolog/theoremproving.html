    <br><br>

    Is Prolog a <b>theorem prover</b>? Richard O'Keefe said it best:

    <div>
      <blockquote class="box">
        <br>
        Prolog is an efficient programming language because it is a
        very stupid theorem prover.
        <br><br>
      </blockquote>
    </div>

    Thus, there is a <i>connection</i> between Prolog and theorem
    proving. In fact, execution of a Prolog program can be regarded as
    a special case of <i>resolution</i>, called SLDNF&nbsp;resolution.

    <br><br>

    However, Prolog is <i>not</i> a full-fledged theorem prover. In
    particular, Prolog is logically <i>incomplete</i> due to its
    depth-first search strategy: Prolog may be unable to find a
    resolution refutation even if one&nbsp;exists.

    <br><br>

    <b>But</b>, and that is the critical point, we can of
    course <b>implement</b> theorem provers in&nbsp;Prolog! This is
    because Prolog is a
    Turing&nbsp;complete <b>programming&nbsp;language</b>, and every
    theorem prover that can be implemented on a computer
    can <i>also</i> be implemented in&nbsp;Prolog.

    <br><br>

    Theorem provers often require some kind
    of <a href="sorting#searching"><i>search</i></a>, such as a search
    for <i>proofs</i> or&nbsp;<i>counterexamples</i>. It is very easy
    to implement various search strategies in Prolog: We <i>can</i>,
    but need not, reuse its built-in depth-first search.

    <br><br>

    Here as an example of a theorem prover written in Prolog,
    implementing the <i>resolution calculus</i>
    for <b>propositional&nbsp;logic</b>:

    <pre>
pl_resolution(Clauses0, Chain) :-
        maplist(<a href="sorting#sort">sort</a>, Clauses0, Clauses), % remove duplicates
        length(Chain, _),
        pl_derive_empty_clause(Chain, Clauses).

pl_derive_empty_clause([], Clauses) :-
        member([], Clauses).
pl_derive_empty_clause([C|Cs], Clauses) :-
        pl_resolvent(C, Clauses, Rs),
        pl_derive_empty_clause(Cs, [Rs|Clauses]).

pl_resolvent((As0-Bs0) --&gt; Rs, Clauses, Rs) :-
        member(As0, Clauses),
        member(Bs0, Clauses),
        select(Q, As0, As),
        select(not(Q), Bs0, Bs),
        append(As, Bs, Rs0),
        <a href="sorting#sort">sort</a>(Rs0, Rs), % remove duplicates
        maplist(dif(Rs), Clauses).
    </pre>

    The complete file is available
    from <a href="/logic/plres.pl"><b><tt>plres.pl</tt></b></a>.

    <br><br>

    Here is an example query, using <tt>portray_clause/1</tt> to print
    the resulting refutation&nbsp;chain in such a&nbsp;way that any
    subsequent program that <i>verifies</i> the&nbsp;proof can easily
    read&nbsp;it with the built-in predicate&nbsp;<tt>read/1</tt>:

    <pre>
?- Clauses = <b>[[p,not(q)], [not(p),not(s)], [s,not(q)], [q]]</b>,
   pl_resolution(Clauses, Rs),
   maplist(portray_clause, Rs).
    </pre>

    It leads to the following refutation chain:

    <pre>
[p, not(q)]-[not(p), not(s)] --&gt;
	[not(q), not(s)].
[s, not(q)]-[not(q), not(s)] --&gt;
	[not(q)].
[q]-[not(q)] --&gt;
	[].
    </pre>

    Note in particular:

    <ul>
      <li>We are <i>not</i> using Prolog's built-in search strategy as
        the search strategy of the&nbsp;prover! In this case, the
        prover uses <b>iterative deepening</b> to
        guarantee&nbsp;<i>refutation-completeness</i>: <i>If</i> a
        refutation exists, <i>then</i> it is found. Iterative
        deepening is easy to implement in Prolog,
        since <tt>length/2</tt> creates longer and longer lists on
        backtracking, and they can be used for limiting
        the&nbsp;search. Iterative deepening may seem like a very
        inefficient search strategy at first glance, but it is in fact
        an <i>optimal</i> search strategy under very general
        assumptions.</li>
      <li>We are <i>not</i> using Prolog variables to represent
        variables from the object level! In this case,
        Prolog <i>atoms</i> represent propositional variables. This is
        called a <b>ground&nbsp;representation</b> of variables. If we
        use Prolog variables instead, then we can
        use <b>Boolean&nbsp;constraints</b> as an alternative solution
        method for showing that the formula is unsatisfiable:

        <pre>
?- sat(P + ~Q), sat(~P + ~S), sat(S + ~Q), sat(Q).
<b>false</b>.
        </pre>

        The choice of <a href="data">data representation</a> can
        thus significantly influence how we can reason about
        such&nbsp;formulas.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Therefore, when discussing theorem provers that are implemented
    using&nbsp;Prolog, we must keep in mind that the way Prolog works
    internally can differ significantly from the <i>implemented</i>
    behaviour of the prover&nbsp;itself: Its search strategy, its
    representation of variables, its logical properties, and indeed
    anything at all can differ from the way Prolog&mdash;regarded as a
    simplistic theorem prover&mdash;works internally, since we are
    using Prolog only as one of many possible implementation
    languages for theorem&nbsp;provers.

    <br><br>

    That being said, many properties make Prolog an <i>especially
      suitable</i> language for <i>implementing</i> theorem provers.
    For example:

    <ul>
      
      <li>Prolog's built-in <b>search</b> and <b>backtracking</b> can
      be readily used when searching for proofs and
      counterexamples</li>
      
      <li><b>complete</b> search strategies, such as iterative deepening,
      can be easily expressed in Prolog</li>

      <li>Prolog's <b>logical variables</b> can often be used to
        represent variables from the object&nbsp;level, allowing us
        to <i>absorb</i> built-in Prolog features
        like <b>unification</b> </li>

      <li>built-in <b>constraints</b> allow for
        declarative <b>specifications</b> that often lead to very
        elegant and efficient programs.</li>
    </ul>

    Other examples of theorem provers implemented in Prolog are:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/presprover/"><b>Presprover</b></a>: Proves formulas
        of <i>Presburger&nbsp;arithmetic</i></li>
      <li><a href="/various/trs.pl"><b><tt>trs.pl</tt></b></a>: Implements a
        completion procedure for <i>Term Rewriting&nbsp;Systems</i> in
        Prolog.</li>
    </ul>

    Many <a href="puzzles">logic puzzles</a> can be solved by applying
    some form of theorem&nbsp;proving.

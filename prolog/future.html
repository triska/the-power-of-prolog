    <center><h2>Lessons from the past</h2></center>

    Prolog is harder to learn than many other programming languages.

    <br><br>

    In part, this is due to inherent reasons: Prolog is simpler and
    more powerful than many other programming languages, and so it
    takes longer to get used to this if you are more familiar with
    low-level languages.

    <br><br>

    However, a far more important cause is found in limitations of
    existing teaching material: In many cases, Prolog is being taught
    exactly like it was taught in the 1980s and&nbsp;1990s.  Outdated
    teaching material leads to broken promises: The use of low-level
    and impure language features complicates or prevents logical
    reasoning about Prolog&nbsp;programs, forcing students to think
    procedurally about their programs <i>instead</i> of declaratively.
    
    <br><br>

    In the past, this has resulted in a lot of frustration, wrong
    impressions and <a href="horror">coding&nbsp;horror</a>. For
    beginners, it is easy to get sidetracked and start wrestling with
    low-level issues while losing sight of much more important
    principles. Do not fall into this&nbsp;trap!

    <br><br>

    Prolog is also hard to <i>teach</i>, since it is hard to keep all
    informal statements you make about Prolog&nbsp;programs
    sufficiently general to cover all possible
    usage&nbsp;modes. Conscious effort is necessary to convey this
    generality to beginners.

    <center><h2>Current developments</h2></center>

    In the Prolog community, most current developments are focused on
    increasing <a href="purity"><b>logical purity</b></a>, and
    making pure code more feature-rich and efficient.

    <br><br>

    The <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/iso-prolog/">ISO
    standardization process</a> is an important means to improve
    compatibility between different Prolog systems.

    <a href="web">Web services</a> and data analysis are
    increasingly relevant application areas for&nbsp;Prolog.

    <br><br>

    Most recent and ongoing developments of Prolog happen in
    universities and in institutions that are closely associated
    with&nbsp;academia. Important contemporary research areas include
    <i>probabilistic</i> logic programming, answer&nbsp;set
    programming&nbsp;(ASP) and language dialects that satisfy certain
    safety&nbsp;criteria or other interesting declarative properties.

    <br><br>

    As an application programmer and Prolog practitioner, you can
    contribute to these developments by getting acquainted with modern
    Prolog&nbsp;features, applying them in your own&nbsp;programs, and
    discussing opportunities for&nbsp;improvements with your
    Prolog&nbsp;vendor. Continuous and wide-spread usage helps to
    ensure that these features are constantly improving.

    <center><h2>The begin</h2></center>

    The advent and wide availability of new, declarative language
    features justify and moreover <i>necessitate</i> that
    we <i>teach Prolog&nbsp;differently</i> than we did in
    the&nbsp;past.

    <br><br>

    Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly inappropriate to dedicate a
    significant portion of your lectures to explaining the intricacies
    of low-level language&nbsp;constructs that have long
    been&nbsp;superseded by more general replacements. The time is
    better spent elsewhere: in explaining the foundations of logic
    programming in such a way that modern language constructs
    are <i>naturally</i> covered. This retains full generality and
    allows <i>both</i> declarative <i>and</i> procedural readings
    instead of precluding one or the&nbsp;other.

    <br><br>

    To really appreciate modern Prolog&nbsp;features, you also have to
    take into account their&nbsp;history: Previous generations of
    Prolog instructors were acutely aware of the declarative
    limitations associated with the constructs they were teaching, but
    had no other options. In many cases, the instructors themselves
    were also among the pioneers in the difficult search for more
    elegant and more general constructs.

    <br><br>

    For instance, consider the following section from
    a <a href="okeefe.txt">manuscript</a> by Richard O'Keefe, written no
    later than&nbsp;1984:

    <pre>
<b>Instantiation Faults</b>

The fifth kind of error is when a question has too many variables in it.
Now this logically speaking is no error at all.  The question "plus(X,X,Y)"
has a perfectly good set of solutions {(X,Y)|X is an integer and Y=2*X}.
    </pre>
    It is evident from this draft that very declarative features have
    been anticipated for several decades. It has simply taken a
    certain amount of&nbsp;time until the techniques that were
    envisioned and even outlined by many pioneers were
    fully&nbsp;realized. Today, we get in full accordance with what
    the draft envisaged:

    <pre>
?- X + X #= Y.
<b>2*X#=Y</b>.
    </pre>

    By now, declarative features like constraints are widely spread
    and available at least to some extent in all popular Prolog
    systems. For many people working in declarative language research,
    this is a <i>dream come true</i>, and still materializing. These
    features are <i>meant to be used</i>. I mean not only as
    interesting curiosities, but as <b>integral parts</b> of the
    language. Prolog systems that do not yet include some of these
    features <i>will adopt&nbsp;them</i> as they become
    more&nbsp;popular.

    <br><br>

    In the future, the most influential Prolog books will be those
    which most explicitly expose the <b>pure&nbsp;core</b>
    of&nbsp;Prolog and the unique advantages and
    application&nbsp;opportunities of logic&nbsp;programming and
    constraints, such&nbsp;as:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="debugging"><b>declarative debugging</b></a></li>
      <li><a href="clpfd"><b>declarative integer arithmetic</b></a></li>
      <li><a href="optimization"><b>combinatorial optimization.</b></a></li>
    </ul>

    By fully embracing such concepts and using them to their utmost
    advantage, future generations may at last behold and
    benefit&nbsp;from the true power of&nbsp;Prolog.

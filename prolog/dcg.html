    <br><br>

    <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>

    A Prolog <b>definite clause grammar</b> (DCG) describes
    a <a href="data#list">list</a>. Operationally, DCGs can be used
    to <i>parse</i>, <i>generate</i>, <i>complete</i> and <i>check</i>
    lists.

    <br><br>

    DCGs are of great significance for Prolog: From a
    historical perspective, Prolog originated from systems that were
    designed for natural language processing, and a built-in mechanism
    for efficient parsing that also preserves Prolog's logical
    characteristics was one of the most important milestones in its
    development. From a practical perspective, DCGs are frequently
    used to describe lists because they are so convenient to&nbsp;use.

    <br><br>
    A DCG is defined by <i>rules</i>. A <b>DCG rule</b> has the form:

    <pre>
Head --&gt; Body.
    </pre>

    A rule's <i>body</i> consists of terminal&nbsp;sequences,
    nonterminals, and grammar&nbsp;goals.
    A <b>terminal&nbsp;sequence</b> is a list, and stands for the
    elements it&nbsp;contains. These elements are
    <i>terminal&nbsp;symbols</i> of the grammar. A <b>nonterminal</b>
    refers to a DCG or other grammar construct, and stands for the
    elements it describes. A nonterminal therefore stands for a
    sequence of terminal&nbsp;symbols. A <b>grammar&nbsp;goal</b> is
    written in curly&nbsp;brackets as <tt>{&nbsp;Goal&nbsp;}</tt> and
    is used to invoke Prolog&nbsp;goals within a grammar.
    
    We use the <i>nonterminal indicator</i>&nbsp;<tt>A//N</tt> to
    refer to the nonterminal&nbsp;<tt>A</tt> with
    arity&nbsp;<tt>N</tt>. Note that&nbsp;<tt>//</tt> distinguishes it
    from a
    Prolog <a href="concepts#predicate"><i>predicate&nbsp;indicator</i></a>.

    <br><br>

    As an example of a DCG, let us describe lists whose every element
    is the atom&nbsp;<tt>a</tt>. We shall use the
    nonterminal&nbsp;<tt>as//0</tt> to refer to such lists:

    <pre>
as --&gt; [].
as --&gt; [a], as.
    </pre>

    The first rule states: The empty list is such a list. In the
    second rule, we read the comma as "<i>and then</i>". Therefore,
    the second rule states: A list that contains as its first element
    the atom&nbsp;<tt>a</tt> <i>and then</i> only
    atoms&nbsp;<tt>a</tt> is also such a list.

    <br><br>

    To invoke a grammar rule, we use Prolog's
    built-in <tt>phrase/2</tt> predicate. The first argument is,
    syntactically, a DCG&nbsp;<i>body</i>. <tt>phrase(Body,
    Ls)</tt> is true iff&nbsp;<tt>Body</tt> describes the
    list&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt>.

    <br><br>

    For example, let us use the single nonterminal&nbsp;<tt>as//0</tt>
    to ask for all lists that it describes, by posting
    the <a href="concepts#toplevel">most general query</a>:

    <pre>
?- phrase(as, Ls).
<b>   Ls = []
;  Ls = [a]
;  Ls = [a,a]
;  Ls = [a,a,a]
;  Ls = [a,a,a,a]
;  ...</b>
    </pre>

    Prolog lets us write lists of <i>characters</i>,
    i.e., <a href="data#string">strings</a>, very conveniently if the
    Prolog flag <tt>double_quotes</tt> is set to <tt>chars</tt>, for
    example by posting the query:

    <pre>
?- set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, chars).
<b>true.</b>
    </pre>

    or by adding the following directive in your initialisation file
    or program:

    <div>
      <pre class="box">:- set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, chars).</pre>
    </div>

    We strongly recommend using this setting for better readability
    of programs, queries and answers. In Scryer&nbsp;Prolog and
    Tau&nbsp;Prolog, this is already the default setting.

    <br><br>

    With <tt>double_quotes</tt> set to <tt>chars</tt>, the list of
    characters <tt>[a,a,a]</tt> can be written equivalently
    as <tt>"aaa"</tt>, and a Prolog system may therefore report the
    solutions above equivalently and more compactly as:

    <pre>
?- phrase(as, Ls).
<b>   Ls = []
;  Ls = "a"
;  Ls = "aa"
;  Ls = "aaa"
;  Ls = "aaaa"
;  ...</b>
    </pre>

    Throughout this text, we assume that the Prolog
      flag <tt>double_quotes</tt> is set to <tt>chars</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Examples of more specific queries and the system's answers:

    <pre>
?- phrase(as, "aaa").
<b>   true</b>
;  false.

?- phrase(as, "bcd").
<b>false.</b>

?- phrase(as, [a,X,a]).
<b>   X = a</b>
;  false.
    </pre>

    <center><h2>Describing sequences with <tt>seq//1</tt>, <tt>seqq//1</tt> and <tt>...//0</tt></h2></center>

    Let us define the nonterminal <tt>seq//1</tt> to describe a
    sequence of elements. We use its single argument to refer to the
    sequence that it describes, represented as a list:

    <div>
      <pre class="box">
seq([])     --&gt; [].
seq([E|Es]) --&gt; [E], seq(Es).</pre>
    </div>

    Sample use case:

    <pre>
?- phrase(("Hello, ",seq(Cs),"!"), "Hello, all!").
<b>   Cs = "all"</b>
;  false.
    </pre>

    Note that in cases where we use DCGs only to <i>generate</i>
    lists, you might be tempted to define <tt>seq//1</tt> as follows:

    <pre>
badseq(Ls) --&gt; Ls.
    </pre>

    This still works as expected in cases like:

    <pre>
?- phrase(badseq("abc"), Ls).
<b>   Ls = "abc".</b>
    </pre>

    However, it is still not a good idea for two reasons: First, it
    cannot be used in the other direction and is thus not a pure
    relation:

    <pre>
?- phrase(badseq(Ls), "abc").
<b>ERROR: call_dcg/3: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated</b>
    </pre>

    Second, such a simplistic definition can be tricked into invoking
    arbitrary code by specifying <tt>{Goal}</tt> as the argument, as
    in:

    <pre>
?- phrase(badseq({halt}), _).
    </pre>

    For these two reasons, it is better to use the definition
    of <tt>seq//1</tt> shown above to refer to arbitrary lists
    with&nbsp;DCGs.

    <br><br>

    Using <tt>seq//1</tt>, we can define <tt>seqq//1</tt> to describe
    a sequence of sequences:

    <div>
      <pre class="box">
seqq([]) --&gt; [].
seqq([Es|Ess]) --&gt;
        seq(Es),
        seqq(Ess).</pre>
    </div>

    Sample use:

    <pre>
?- phrase(seqq(["ab","cd","ef"]), Ls).
<b>   Ls = "abcdef".</b>
    </pre>

    This is an elegant way to describe the <i>concatenation</i> of
    arbitrarily many lists.

    <br><br>

    It is sometimes useful to describe "any sequence at all", and we can
    do this with the nonterminal&nbsp;<tt>...//0</tt> which is
    equivalent to <tt>seq(_)</tt>:

    <div>
      <pre class="box">... --&gt; [] | [_], ... .</pre>
    </div>

    The grammar construct <tt>('|')//2</tt> and its
    equivalent&nbsp;<tt>(;)//2</tt> correspond to the Prolog control
    structure&nbsp;<tt>(;)/2</tt> and are read as "or". When parsing
    with DCGs, using <tt>('|')/2</tt> is preferable over <tt>(;)//2</tt>
    due to existing conventions for writing grammars.

    <br><br>

    <tt>seq//1</tt>, <tt>seqq//1</tt> and <tt>...//0</tt> are very
    versatile nonterminals and can be used to elegantly solve many
    tasks that involve reasoning over lists. For example, the last
    element of a list can be described with:

    <pre>
?- phrase((...,[Last]), "hello").
<b>   Last = o</b>
;  false.
    </pre>

    As another example, consecutively repeated elements in a list can be described with:

    <pre>
?- phrase((...,[E,E],...), Ls).
<b>   Ls = [E,E]
;  Ls = [E,E,_A]
;  Ls = [E,E,_A,_B]
;  Ls = [E,E,_A,_B,_C]
;  ...</b>
    </pre>

    Using iterative deepening, we obtain a <i>fair</i> enumeration of answers:

    <pre>
?- length(Ls, _), phrase((...,[E,E],...), Ls).
<b>   Ls = [E,E]
;  Ls = [E,E,_A]
;  Ls = [_A,E,E]
;  Ls = [E,E,_A,_B]
;  Ls = [_A,E,E,_B]
;  Ls = [_A,_B,E,E]
;  ...</b>
    </pre>


    In Scryer Prolog, <tt>seq//1</tt> and <tt>seqq//1</tt> are
    provided
    by <a href="https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/blob/master/src/lib/dcgs.pl"><tt>library(dcgs)</tt></a>.

    <center><h2>List reversal, palindromes and other exercises</h2></center>

    When reasoning about lists or solving exercises involving lists,
    consider using DCGs for convenience.

    <br><br>

    For example, the <i>reversal</i> of a list can be described with:

    <pre>
reversal([]) --&gt; [].
reversal([L|Ls]) --&gt; reversal(Ls), [L].
    </pre>

    Sample query and answer:

    <pre>
?- phrase(reversal("abcd"), Ls).
<b>   Ls = "dcba".</b>
    </pre>

    As another example, a <i>palindrome</i> can be described with:

    <pre>
palindrome --&gt; [].
palindrome --&gt; [_].
palindrome --&gt; [E], palindrome, [E].
    </pre>

    This definition can be used to <i>generate</i>, to <i>complete</i>
    and to <i>check</i> palindromes. For example:

    <pre>
?- phrase(palindrome, "hellolleh").
<b>   true</b>
;  false.


?- phrase(palindrome, Ls).
<b>   Ls = []
;  Ls = [_A]
;  Ls = [_A,_A]
;  Ls = [_A,_B,_A]
;  Ls = [_A,_B,_B,_A]
;  ...</b>
    </pre>

    <center><h2>Relating trees to lists</h2></center>

    Let us now use a DCG to relate a binary tree to the in-order
    sequence of its node names. Let us assume a binary tree consists
    of leaves represented by the atom&nbsp;<tt>nil</tt> and inner
    nodes of the form&nbsp;<tt>node(Name, Left, Right)</tt>,
    where <tt>Left</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>Right</tt> are themselves binary
    trees. To obtain the in-order sequence of node names, consider:

    <pre>
tree_nodes(nil) --&gt; [].
tree_nodes(node(Name, Left, Right)) --&gt;
        tree_nodes(Left),
        [Name],
        tree_nodes(Right).
    </pre>

    Example:

    <pre>
?- phrase(tree_nodes(node(a, node(b, nil,
                                     node(c, nil, nil)),
                             node(d, nil, nil))), Ns).
   <b>Ns = "bcad".</b>
    </pre>

    You can obtain other orders by moving the
    terminal&nbsp;sequence&nbsp;<tt>[Name]</tt> in the DCG body.

    <br><br>
    <center><h2 id="leftrecursion">Left recursion</h2></center>

    Conversely, given a sequence of node names, what are the trees
    that yield this sequence:

    <pre>
?- phrase(tree_nodes(Tree), "abcd").
<b>   Tree = node(a,nil,node(b,nil,node(c,nil,node(d,nil,nil))))</b>
;  % <i>(nontermination)</i>
    </pre>

    The system yields one (correct) solution, then loops. This is
    because the grammar is left-recursive: We recursively refer to a
    nonterminal (<tt>tree_nodes//1</tt>) before anything else. To be
    able to use this grammar for finding all matching trees, we need
    to encode that for the second rule to apply, at least one list
    element must be available since the rule contains exactly one
    terminal, and we need to check this in advance to avoid unbounded
    recursion. We can do this by introducing two additional arguments
    that let us limit the number of rule applications to the given
    list's length:

    <pre>
tree_nodes(nil, Ls, Ls) --&gt; [].
tree_nodes(node(Name, Left, Right), [_|Ls0], Ls) --&gt;
        tree_nodes(Left, Ls0, Ls1),
        [Name],
        tree_nodes(Right, Ls1, Ls).
    </pre>

    Each respective pair of additional arguments describes a
    so-called <b>list&nbsp;difference</b>. To understand this method
    and its associated terminology, consider for example the
    pair <tt>Ls0</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>Ls1</tt>. We can interpret
    the <i>difference</i> of these lists as describing the list of
    elements that are consumed by the first recursive invocation
    of <tt>tree_nodes//3</tt> in this example. Analogously, the
    <i>difference</i> of the lists <tt>Ls1</tt> and <tt>Ls</tt> is the
    list of elements consumed by the second invocation. And the
    <i>difference</i> between the lists that occur in the head, i.e.,
    that of <tt>[_|Ls0]</tt> and <tt>Ls</tt>, describes the list of
    elements that are consumed by the entire second&nbsp;rule.

    <br><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/list_differences"><img src="videos/t_list_differences.png" alt="List differences"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    Of course, <i>difference</i> is to be understood in
    a <i>symbolic</i> sense in these cases, not in an arithmetic
    sense. For example, the <i>difference</i> between the
    lists <tt>[A,B,C]</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>[C]</tt>
    is&nbsp;<tt>[A,B]</tt>, the difference between <tt>[X,Y|Ls]</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt> is&nbsp;<tt>[X,Y]</tt>, and the difference
    between <tt>Ls</tt> and <tt>Ls</tt> is&nbsp;<tt>[]</tt>. By
    reasoning about such <i>list&nbsp;differences</i> via argument
    pairs, we can compose and decompose entire lists by reasoning
    about their sublists. This powerful method is in fact also the
    key&nbsp;idea that underlies the
    common <a href="#implementation">transformation</a> of DCGs to
    Prolog&nbsp;predicates. In cases where you are using it, consider
    using DCGs <i>instead</i>. In the present case, we are using list
    differences explicitly because we are using
    them <i>within</i>&nbsp;DCGs.

    <br><br>

    In the literature, you will also encounter the
    term <i>"difference&nbsp;list"</i>. However, this terminology is
    misleading: We are <i>not</i> talking about&mdash;as the name may
    suggest&mdash;a special <i>kind</i> of list. The additional
    arguments are completely
    ordinary&nbsp;<a href="data#list">lists</a>. It is
    their <i>differences</i> that matter especially in such cases.

    <br><br>

    When working with list&nbsp;differences, you may be tempted to
    pass around each pair as a <i>single</i> argument, for example as
    compound terms like <tt>Ls0-Ls1</tt> or <tt>Ls0/Ls1</tt>. However,
    this is not advisable, primarily because you will likely run into
    conflicts with other predicates and DCG&nbsp;expansions, and
    secondarily because it incurs performance overhead for
    constructing, decomposing and managing these compound&nbsp;terms.

    <br><br>

    Example query:

    <pre>
?- Ns = "abcd", phrase(tree_nodes(Tree, Ns, _), Ns).
<b>   Ns = "abcd", Tree = node(a,nil,node(b,nil,node(c,nil,node(d,nil,nil))))
;  Ns = "abcd", Tree = node(a,nil,node(b,nil,node(d,node(c,nil,nil),nil)))
;  Ns = "abcd", Tree = node(a,nil,node(c,node(b,nil,nil),node(d,nil,nil)))
;  ...</b>
    </pre>

    Another option to parse with left-recursive grammars is to use
    your Prolog system's <a href="memoization#tabling">tabling</a>
    mechanism. Combining tabled execution with DCGs
    yields <i>packrat&nbsp;parsing</i>; an interesting paper about
    this topic
    is <a href="https://mercurylang.org/documentation/papers/packrat.pdf"><i>DCGs
    + Memoing = Packrat Parsing, But is it worth it?</i></a> by Ralph
    Becket and Zoltan Somogyi.


    <center><h2 id="semicontext">Semicontext notation</h2></center>

    Using <b>semicontext notation</b>, in now outdated terminology
    also called <i>pushback lists</i> or <i>right-hand context</i>,
    you can insert list elements that were initially not in the list
    that is being parsed. A DCG rule of the form:

    <pre>
Head, <b>[T<sub>1</sub>,...,T<sub>n</sub>]</b> --&gt; Body.
    </pre>

    can be read operationally as: parse the list
    using&nbsp;<tt>Body</tt>, then prepend the
    terms&nbsp;<tt>T<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;T<sub>n</sub></tt> to the remaining list.
    For example:

    <pre>
nt1, <b>[b]</b> --&gt; [a].
nt2      --&gt; [b].
    </pre>

    The body of <tt>nt1//0</tt> describes a list whose single element
    is the atom&nbsp;<tt>a</tt>. Operationally, after <tt>nt1//0</tt>
    has consumed the atom&nbsp;<tt>a</tt> in a list that is being
    parsed, it inserts the atom&nbsp;<tt>b</tt> in front of the
    remaining list. <tt>nt2//0</tt> describes a list whose single
    element is the atom&nbsp;<tt>b</tt>. The following query therefore
    succeeds, since <tt>nt2//0</tt> consumes the atom&nbsp;<tt>b</tt>,
    which is left in the list after <tt>nt1//0</tt> succeeds:

    <pre>
?- phrase((nt1,nt2), "a").
<b>   true.</b>
    </pre>

    We can also use <tt>nt1//0</tt> in isolation. However, the following query
    <i>fails</i> since <tt>phrase/2</tt> only succeeds if all list elements
    are consumed by the given DCG body:

    <pre>
?- phrase(nt1, "a").
<b>false.</b>
    </pre>

    The list difference version <tt>phrase/3</tt> shows what remains
    after <tt>nt1//0</tt> succeeds:

    <pre>
?- phrase(nt1, "a", Rest).
<b>   Rest = "b".</b>
    </pre>

    As expected, the atom&nbsp;<tt>b</tt> remains in the list.

    <br><br>

    Using semicontext notation, we can implement <i>look ahead</i>,
    which lets us inspect the next element in the list without
    removing it. Operationally, we first remove it and then push it
    back:

    <pre>
look_ahead(T), [T] --&gt; [T].
    </pre>

    Example:

    <pre>
?- phrase(look_ahead(T), "a", Rest).
<b>   Rest = "a", T = a.</b>
    </pre>

    <center><h2>Implicitly passing states around</h2></center>

    <a href="#semicontext">Semicontext notation</a> is also useful to
    implicitly pass around a state representation that is only
    accessed and changed by a subset of rules. For example, let us
    count the leaves in a binary tree with the above
    presentation. Without using DCGs, we can relate a tree to the
    number of its leaves as follows:

    <pre>
num_leaves(Tree, N) :-
        num_leaves_(Tree, 0, N).

num_leaves_(nil, N0, N) :- N #= N0 + 1.
num_leaves_(node(_,Left,Right), N0, N) :-
        num_leaves_(Left, N0, N1),
        num_leaves_(Right, N1, N).
    </pre>

    Notice that in the second clause of <tt>num_leaves_/3</tt>, the
    accumulator is only passed through
    as <tt>N0</tt>, <tt>N1</tt>, <tt>...</tt>, <tt>N</tt> and not
    modified directly. When you encounter such a pattern, consider
    using DCG notation to pass around the arguments <i>implicitly</i>.

    In this concrete case, the <i>state</i> we shall pass around is a
    single integer denoting the number of leaves encountered so far.
    To increment the state, we use
    Prolog's <a href="/prolog/clpfd"><b>declarative integer
    arithmetic</b></a> like above. To invoke a Prolog predicate from
    within a DCG body, we use the DCG language
    construct&nbsp;<tt>{}//1</tt>. Operationally, when the
    construct&nbsp;<tt>{Goal}</tt> is encountered in a DCG
    body,&nbsp;<tt>Goal</tt> is called as a Prolog goal. Since
    a&nbsp;DCG must always describe a list, we wrap the state into a
    list and thus describe a list containing a single element. The
    initial state is again sensibly specified as&nbsp;0, and the
    number of leaves is given by the remaining list element
    after <tt>num_leaves_//1</tt> succeeds:

    <pre>
num_leaves(Tree, N) :-
        phrase(num_leaves_(Tree), [0], [N]).

num_leaves_(nil), [N] --&gt; [N0], { N #= N0 + 1 }.
num_leaves_(node(_,Left,Right)) --&gt;
        num_leaves_(Left),
        num_leaves_(Right).
    </pre>

    Notice that the second rule of <tt>num_leaves_//1</tt> makes no
    reference at all to the state, since the number of leaves is not
    modified when an inner node is processed.

    <br><br>
    Example query:

    <pre>
?- num_leaves(node(a,node(b,nil,nil),
                     node(c,nil,
                            node(d,nil,nil))), N).
<b>N = 5.</b>
    </pre>

    The following nonterminals are useful for describing states with
    DCGs:

    <div id="state">
      <pre class="box">
state(S), [S] --&gt; [S].

state(S0, S), [S] --&gt; [S0].</pre>
    </div>

    <b>Note</b>: Code in grey boxes may be useful for you to reuse in
    your own projects.
    <br><br>

    The nonterminal <tt>state(S)</tt> can be read as: "The current
    state is <tt>S</tt>". The nonterminal <tt>state(S0, S)</tt> can be
    read as: "The current state is <tt>S0</tt>, and henceforth it
    is <tt>S</tt>".

    <br><br>

    Using <tt>state//2</tt>, you can write <tt>num_leaves_//1</tt> as:

    <pre>
num_leaves_(nil) --&gt; state(N0, N), { N #= N0 + 1 }.
num_leaves_(node(_,Left,Right)) --&gt;
        num_leaves_(Left),
        num_leaves_(Right).
    </pre>

    This approach is readily generalized to multiple states that are
    threaded through: You can for example use a
    term&nbsp;<tt>s(S1,S2,...,Sn)</tt> in such cases.

    <br><br>

    <center><h2>Reading from files</h2></center>

    In Scryer Prolog, SICStus Prolog and SWI-Prolog, DCGs can be
    transparently applied to files using Ulrich
    Neumerkel's <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/Prolog-inedit/sicstus/pio.pl"><b><tt>library(pio)</tt></b></a>.
    When you need to process input from files, first write a DCG that
    describes the input. This lets you test the DCG in a pure way
    using&nbsp;<tt>phrase/2</tt>, and then apply the DCG to files too
    by simply using <tt>phrase_from_file/2</tt> instead
    of <tt>phrase/2</tt>.

    <br><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/reading_from_files"><img src="videos/t_reading_from_files.png" alt="Reading from Files"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>


    <br><br>

    In our first example, we read a whole file to a <i>list of
    characters</i>. This is very easy to do with <tt>seq//1</tt> as
    defined above. For example, to read the contents of the
    file <tt>dcg.html</tt> to a list of characters, we use:

    <pre>
?- phrase_from_file(seq(Chars), 'dcg.html').
<b>   Chars = "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;ht ..."</b>
;  false.
    </pre>

    As another example, consider the following DCG that
    uses <tt>seq//1</tt> to refer to a subsequence of characters:

    <pre>
like(What) --&gt; "I like ", seq(What), ".", ... .
    </pre>

    As before, we can use this DCG to parse a given list of characters:

    <pre>
?- phrase(like(What), "I like it. Anything can follow!").
<b>   What = "it"</b>
;  false.
    </pre>

    As expected, <tt>What</tt> is unified with the atoms&nbsp;<tt>i</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>t</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Moreover, using <tt>library(pio)</tt> and
    its <tt>phrase_from_file/2</tt>, we can transparently parse from a
    file with the same DCG. Assume that the
    file&nbsp;<tt>like.txt</tt> starts with the string "I like it."

    <pre>
?- phrase_from_file(like(What), 'like.txt').
<b>   What = "it"</b>
;  false.
    </pre>

    Again, <tt>What</tt> is unified with the atoms&nbsp;<tt>i</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>t</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Pure input via <tt>library(pio)</tt> can be implemented in such a
    way that it uses memory efficiently when parsing files: First, the
    file can be read <i>lazily</i>, reading only as much as is needed.
    Second, file contents can be very compactly represented in memory
    if your Prolog system supports an
    <a href="data#string">efficient representation</a> of lists of
    characters. Third, file contents that are no longer relevant for
    parsing can be reclaimed automatically if your Prolog system
    satisfies the properties outlined
    in <a href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/papers/PDF/2008-ciclops.pdf"><i>Precise
    Garbage Collection in Prolog</i></a>.

    <br><br>

    For these reasons, <tt>library(pio)</tt> is well-suited
    also for parsing large files.

    <br><br>

    <center><h2>Parsing tricks and techniques</h2></center>

    When parsing, we often want to consume tokens <i>greedily</i>,
    meaning that the <i>longest</i> match should be given priority. We
    can do this by ordering the DCG&nbsp;rules accordingly. For
    example, the following DCG describes a list of whitespace
    characters in such a way that the longest such sequence is the
    first solution, using <tt>char_type/2</tt>
    from <a href="https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/blob/master/src/lib/charsio.pl"><tt>library(charsio)</tt></a> for character classification:

    <pre>
ws --&gt; [W], { char_type(W, whitespace) }, ws.
ws --&gt; [].
    </pre>

    Identifiers that must start with a letter and may contain
    either letters or digits can be parsed by applying this technique:

    <pre>
identifier([A|As]) --&gt; [A], { char_type(A, alpha) }, symbol_r(As).

symbol_r([A|As]) --&gt; [A], { char_type(A, alnum) }, symbol_r(As).
symbol_r([])     --&gt; [].
    </pre>

    As another technique that is sometimes useful for parsing, here
    are DCG rules that describe a list of <i>lines</i> that are
    terminated by line feed or end of file:

    <div>
      <pre class="box">
lines([])     --&gt; call(eos), !.
lines([L|Ls]) --&gt; line(L), lines(Ls).

line([])     --&gt; ( "\n" | call(eos) ), !.
line([C|Cs]) --&gt; [C], line(Cs).

eos([], []).</pre>
    </div>

    The nonterminal <tt>call//1</tt> is used to call a Prolog
    predicate in such a way that the implicit DCG arguments are made
    available as explicit arguments. We need this to describe the
    condition "end of string". The grammar construct
    <tt>!//0</tt> is used like the corresponding Prolog control
    structure.

    <br><br>

    We can use these definitions to obtain the contents of a file as
    a list of lines for further reasoning:

    <pre>
?- phrase_from_file(lines(Ls), 'like.txt').
<b>   Ls = ["I like it. Anythi ..."].</b>
    </pre>

    <b>Note</b>: <tt>eos/2</tt> is comparatively rarely needed. In the
    above case it is used because <i>anything else</i> is the
    beginning of a new line. Typically, you can more directly express
    what you want to describe, and <tt>phrase/2</tt>
    and <tt>phrase_from_file/2</tt> only succeed if
    the <i>complete</i> list or file matches the description.
    Therefore, it is typically not necessary to explicitly refer to
    "end of the string".

    <br><br>
    
    <center><h2 id="output">Describing output</h2></center>

    DCGs are also useful for describing <i>output</i>, because output
    is a list of characters.
    In <a href="https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/blob/master/src/lib/format.pl"><tt>library(format)</tt></a>,
    Scryer Prolog provides the nonterminal <tt>format_//2</tt> to
    declaratively describe output based on a <i>format&nbsp;string</i>
    that defines the layout of specified arguments.

    <br><br>

    For example, we can describe a <i>table</i> with <tt>format_//2</tt>:

    <pre>
table --&gt;
    row([this,is,a]),
    row([very,nice,table]).

row(Ls) --&gt; format_("~t~w~7+~t~w~7+~t~w~7+~n", Ls).
    </pre>

    Sample query and its results:

    <pre>
?- phrase(table, Ts).
<b>   Ts = "   this     is      ..."</b>.
    </pre>

    An important advantage of this declarative way to describe output
    is that we can write <i>test&nbsp;cases</i> and reason about it:
    It is quite hard to reason about output that only appears on the
    system terminal, with no other tangible manifestation. In
    contrast, it is easy to state properties that must hold about a
    list of characters.

    <br><br>

    When needed, we can show the table on the terminal with a single
    call of&nbsp;<tt>format/2</tt>:

    <pre>
?- phrase(table, Ts), format("~s", [Ts]).
<b>   this     is      a
   very   nice  table</b>
   Ts = "   this     is      ...".
    </pre>

    <center><h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2></center>

    To see how DCGs are internally implemented in Scryer Prolog, we
    can use <tt>listing/1</tt> from <tt>library(format)</tt>. For
    example, to see the actual source code of <tt>num_leaves_//1</tt>,
    we declare the nonterminal dynamic via the <tt>dynamic/1</tt>
    directive, and use:

    <pre>
?- listing(num_leaves_//1).
<b>num_leaves_(nil,A,B) :-
   state(C,D,A,E),
   D#=C+1,
   E=B.
num_leaves_(node(A,B,C),D,E) :-
   num_leaves_(B,D,F),
   num_leaves_(C,F,E).</b>
    </pre>

    We see that internally, the two DCG rules
    of <tt>num_leaves_//1</tt> were translated into Prolog rules with
    two additional arguments, following mechanical rewriting steps.
    The translation of DCGs to Prolog code is done
    by <tt>term_expansion/2</tt>, a mechanism analogous
    to <a href="macros"><b>macros</b></a> in other languages.

    <br><br>

    For portability, it is best not to rely on a particular expansion
    method. Instead, use semicontext notation to refer to states and
    always use the <tt>phrase/[2,3]</tt> interface to invoke a DCG.
    This way, a Prolog system is free to apply a different expansion
    method that may be more efficient. For example, the last two
    arguments may as well be swapped and allow more efficient
    predicate calls this way due to specifics of a particular virtual
    machine.

    <br><br>
    <center><h2>Using DCGs</h2></center>

    Consider using DCGs if you are:
    <ul>
      <li>describing a list</li>
      <li>reading from a file</li>
      <li>passing around a state representation that only a few
        predicates actually use or modify.</li>
    </ul>

    In every serious Prolog program, you will find many opportunities to
    use DCGs due to some subset of the above reasons.

    <br><br>

    Let us study one side-by-side comparison of a regular Prolog
    predicate and an equivalent DCG nonterminal to recall several
    important aspects of using DCGs and make some additional
    observations. We take the well-known Prolog
    predicate <tt>include/3</tt> as an example:

    <center>
      <table style="border: 1px dotted; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em">
        <tr><td style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-right: 1em"><center><b>regular Prolog</b></center></td>
          <td><center><b>Prolog DCG</b></center></td></tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="padding-right: 1em">
            <pre>
include(Goal, List, Included) :-
        include_(List, Goal, Included).

include_([], _, []).
include_([L|Ls], Goal, Included0) :-
        (   call(Goal, L) -&gt;
            Included0 = [L|Included]
        ;   Included0 = Included
        ),
        include_(Ls, Goal, Included).
            </pre>
          </td>
          <td style="padding-right: 1em">
            <pre>
include(Goal, List, Included) :-
        <b>phrase</b>(include_(List, Goal), Included).

include_([], _) --&gt; [].
include_([L|Ls], Goal) --&gt;
        (   { call(Goal, L) } -&gt;
            [L]
        ;   []
        ),
        include_(Ls, Goal).
            </pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>

    Usage example for both versions:

    <pre>
?- include(integer, [a,b,c,1,2,e], Is).
<b>Is = [1, 2]</b>.
    </pre>

    We recall and note in particular:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>phrase/2</tt> must of course be used to refer to a DCG
        nonterminal within a regular Prolog predicate</li>
      <li>conversely, <tt>{}//1</tt> is used to call a regular Prolog goal within a DCG</li>
      <li>the DCG version needs fewer explicit arguments, making it slightly easier to read and understand</li>
      <li>although it is strongly related to the previous point, it is
        still worth mentioning explicitly that the DCG version also
        refers to fewer <i>variables</i></li>
      <li>using a DCG makes immediately clear that a <i>list</i> is
      being described.
    </ul>

    Take your time and see for yourself which of the two versions you
    find easier to read and understand.

    DCGs are currently being considered for inclusion in the Prolog
    ISO&nbsp;standard.

    <br><br>

    DCG notation is similar to <i>monads</i> which have been adopted as
    one of the most versatile among several competing formalisms in
    functional programming languages like&nbsp;Haskell. Other
    programming languages may also benefit from such constructs.

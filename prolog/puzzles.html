    <center><h1>Logic Puzzles with Prolog</h1></center>
    <br><br>

    Which language could be <i>more</i> suitable than&nbsp;Prolog for
    solving <b>logic&nbsp;puzzles</b>? (Answer: <tt>false</tt>.)

    <br><br>

    A vast array of interesting and commonly known logic puzzles can
    be elegantly and efficiently solved with Prolog and constraints.
    Some puzzles can be very directly modeled and solved
    as <a href="optimization">combinatorial&nbsp;tasks</a>, others
    need more effort to find a suitable formulation as
    such&nbsp;tasks, and yet other puzzles require a search over
    different&nbsp;<a href="/tist/">states</a>. In the following, we
    consider a few example&nbsp;puzzles.

    <br><br>
    <center><h2>Knights and Knaves</h2></center>

    For example, consider a few puzzles that appear in
    Raymond&nbsp;Smullyan's <i>What Is the Name of This&nbsp;Book?</i>
    and Maurice&nbsp;Kraitchik's <i>Mathematical&nbsp;Recreations</i>.

    <br><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/knights_and_knaves"><img src="videos/t_knights_and_knaves.png" alt="Knights and Knaves"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    <div class="example">
      <b>Premise</b>: You are on an island where every inhabitant is
      either a <i>knight</i> or a&nbsp;<i>knave</i>. Knights always
      tell the truth, and knaves always lie.
    </div>
    <br><br>


    Using Prolog and
    its <a href="/clpb/"><b>CLP(B)&nbsp;constraints</b></a>, we can
    model this situation as follows:

    <ul>
      <li> use <b>0</b> (<b>false</b>) to denote a&nbsp;<i>knave</i></li>
      <li> use <b>1</b> (<b>true</b>) to denote a&nbsp;<i>knight</i></li>
      <li> use one Boolean <i>variable</i> for each inhabitant, its
      truth&nbsp;value representing whether the person is a knave or
      a&nbsp;knight.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
      <b>Example 1</b>: You meet 2&nbsp;inhabitants, A and&nbsp;B. A
      says: "Either I am a knave or B is a knight."
    </div>
    <br>

    A <i>single&nbsp;query</i> over Boolean variables suffices to
    determine the kind of each inhabitant, by expressing the relation
    between A and the truth&nbsp;value of the statement:


    <pre>
?- sat(A =:= ~A+B).
<b>   A = 1, B = 1.</b>
    </pre>

    This shows that <i>both</i> A and&nbsp;B are knights.

    <br>
    <div class="example">
      <b>Example 2</b>: A says: "I am a knave, but B isn't."
    </div>
    <br>

    Translated to Boolean constraints, this corresponds to:

    <pre>
?- sat(A =:= ~A*B).
<b>   A = 0, B = 0.</b>
    </pre>

    Thus, in this example, both A and&nbsp;B are <i>knaves</i>.
    <br>

    <div class="example">
    <b>Example 3</b>: A says: "At least one of us is a knave."
    </div>
    <br>

    Using CLP(B) constraints, we can use the Boolean
    expression <tt>card(Ls,Exprs)</tt> to express
    a <i>cardinality&nbsp;constraint</i>: This expression is
    true <i>iff</i> the number of expressions in <tt>Exprs</tt> that
    evaluate to&nbsp;<b>true</b> is a <i>member</i> of the
    list&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt> of integers. Thus, for this example, we can
    use:

    <pre>
?- sat(A =:= card([1,2],[~A,~B])).
<b>   A = 1, B = 0.</b>
    </pre>

    Or, equivalently:

    <pre>
?- sat(A =:= ~A + ~B).
<b>   A = 1, B = 0.</b>
    </pre>

    <div class="example">
      <b>Example 4</b>: You meet 3 inhabitants. A says: "All of us are knaves."
      B says: "Exactly one of us is a knight."
    </div>
    <br>

    We can translate these two statements to a <i>conjunction</i> of
    constraints:

    <pre>
?- sat(A =:= (~A * ~B * ~C)), sat(B =:= card([1],[A,B,C])).
<b>   A = 0, B = 1, C = 0.</b>
    </pre>

    <div class="example">
      <b>Example 5</b>: A says: "B is a knave." B says: "A and C are of
      the same kind." <i>What is C</i>?
    </div>
    <br>

    We can translate this to Prolog as&nbsp;follows:

    <pre>
?- sat(A =:= ~B), sat(B =:= (A=:=C)).
<b>   C = 0, clpb:sat(A=\=B).</b>
    </pre>

    This shows that C is definitely a <i>knave</i>. A and&nbsp;B can
    both be either knights or knaves, <i>and</i> they are of
    different&nbsp;kinds, which is indicated by the residual&nbsp;goal.

    <center><h2>Which answer is correct?</h2></center>

    Many other kinds of puzzles can be modeled by applying exactly the
    same method, i.e., reasoning over <i>Boolean</i> variables.

    Consider for example:

    <br><br>
    <div class="example">
      <b>Which answer is correct?</b>

      <ol>
        <li>All of the below.</li>
        <li>None of the below.</li>
        <li>All of the above.</li>
        <li>At least one of the above.</li>
        <li>None of the above.</li>
        <li>None of the above.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    Again, we can trivially translate this puzzle to statements
    over <b>propositional&nbsp;logic</b>. For example, let us use the
    Boolean&nbsp;variables A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ...,
    A<sub>6</sub> to denote whether or not the corresponding answer
    is&nbsp;selected. Then the different statements can be translated
    to relations over Boolean formulas as&nbsp;follows:

    <pre>
solution([A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6]) :-
        sat(A1 =:= A2*A3*A4*A5*A6),
        sat(A2 =:= ~(A3+A4+A5+A6)),
        sat(A3 =:= A1*A2),
        sat(A4 =:= A1+A2+A3),
        sat(A5 =:= ~(A1+A2+A3+A4)),
        sat(A6 =:= ~(A1+A2+A3+A4+A5)).
    </pre>

    In this formulation, we are again assuming that your
    Prolog&nbsp;system ships with a dedicated constraint solver over
    Boolean&nbsp;domains that implements <tt>sat/1</tt> as it is used
    above. For example, in SICStus Prolog and Scryer&nbsp;Prolog, such
    a solver is available
    as&nbsp;<a href="https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/latest4/html/sicstus.html/lib_002dclpb.html#lib_002dclpb"><tt>library(clpb)</tt></a>.

    <br><br>

    The following interaction shows that only a single answer
    (option&nbsp;<b>5</b>) can be selected in such a way that all
    statements are&nbsp;<i>consistent</i>.

    <pre>
?- solution(Vs).
<b>   Vs = [0,0,0,0,1,0].</b>
    </pre>

    The Prolog system has <i>automatically</i> deduced the single
    admissible answer via constraint&nbsp;<b>propagation</b>.

    <center><h2>Lewis Carroll</h2></center>

    Lewis Carroll was a logic teacher who also published many
    entertaining puzzles.

    <br><br>

    In many of these puzzles, your job is to string together all given
    statements so that they form a chain of implications, typically
    arriving at a result that is surprising or amusing. For example:

    <br>

    <div class="example">
      <ol>
        <li>None of the unnoticed things, met with at sea, are mermaids.</li>
        <li>Things entered in the log, as met with at sea, are sure
          to be worth remembering.</li>
        <li>I have never met with anything worth remembering, when on
          a voyage.</li>
        <li>Things met with at sea, that are noticed, are sure to be
          recorded in the log.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <br>

    Once more, we can translate each of these statements to a formula
    of <b>propositional&nbsp;logic</b>, but this time it is not so
    straight-forward because the language is intentionally a bit
    obfuscated. We make the simplifying assumption that all entities
    mentioned are <i>met with at&nbsp;sea</i>, since this
    qualification occurs, albeit cryptically, in each of the
    statements. Let us use the following abbreviations:

    <br>
    <div style="padding-top: 10pt">
    <table style="border: 1pt solid">
      <tr>
        <td><b>N</b></td><td>it is noticed</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>M</b></td><td>it is a mermaid</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>L</b></td><td>it is entered in the log</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>R</b></td><td>it is worth remembering</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>I</b></td><td>I have seen it</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </div>
    <br>

    Using these abbreviations, we can model the puzzle as follows:

    <pre>
sea([N,M,L,R,I]) :-
        sat(M =&lt; N),   % statement 1
        sat(L =&lt; R),   % statement 2
        sat(I =&lt; ~R),  % statement 3
        sat(N =&lt; L).   % statement 4
    </pre>

    It only remains to find a chain of implications that links all
    statements or their negations:

    <pre>
implication_chain([], Prev) --&gt; [Prev].
implication_chain(Vs0, Prev) --&gt; [Prev],
        { select(V, Vs0, Vs) },
        (   { taut(Prev =&gt; V, 1) } -&gt; implication_chain(Vs, V)
        ;   { taut(Prev =&gt; ~V, 1) } -&gt; implication_chain(Vs, ~V)
        ).
    </pre>

    Sample query:

    <pre>
?- sea(Vs),
   Vs = [N,M,L,R,I],
   select(Start, Vs, Rest),
   phrase(implication_chain(Rest, Start), Cs).
    </pre>

    In this case, the two solutions for <tt>Cs</tt>
    are: <tt>[M,N,L,R,~I]</tt> and <tt>[I,~R,~L,~N,~M]</tt>.
    Informally, this translates to "If it is a mermaid, I have not
    seen it", and "If I have seen it, it is not a mermaid",
    respectively. The whole chain, in the first&nbsp;case, is: If it
    is a mermaid, it is noticed, hence it is entered in the&nbsp;log,
    hence it is worth remembering, hence I have not seen&nbsp;it.
    Informally, the "solution" of this puzzle is: <i>I have never seen
    a&nbsp;mermaid.</i>

    Such deductions also frequently arise or are needed when applying
    Prolog for
    <a href="theoremproving">theorem&nbsp;proving</a>.

    <center><h2 id="cryptoarithmetic">Cryptoarithmetic puzzles</h2></center>

    <i>Cryptoarithmetic puzzles</i> require us to find <i>digits</i>
    corresponding to <i>letters</i> or symbols, such that the
    represented <i>numbers</i> satisfy certain constraints.

    <br><br>

    An example of a cryptoarithmetic puzzle is:

    <pre>
      CP
+     IS      
+    FUN
--------
=   TRUE      
    </pre>

    Different letters correspond to different digits.

    <br><br>

    <a href="clpfd">Integer constraints</a> are a great&nbsp;fit for such
    puzzles. Let us first define the <i>relation</i> between a list of
    digits and the represented number:

    <pre>
digits_number(Ds, N) :-
        length(Ds, _),
        Ds ins 0..9,
        reverse(Ds, RDs),
        <a href="metapredicates#foldl">foldl</a>(pow, RDs, 0-0, N-_).

pow(D, N0-I0, N-I) :-
        N #= N0 + D*10^I0,
        I #= I0 + 1.
    </pre>

    Using <tt>digits_number/2</tt> as a building block, we can ask
    for <i>solutions</i> with:

    <pre>
?- digits_number([C,P], CP),
   digits_number([I,S], IS),
   digits_number([F,U,N], FUN),
   digits_number([T,R,U,E], TRUE),
   CP + IS + FUN #= TRUE,
   Vs = [C,P,I,S,F,U,N,T,R,E],
   all_distinct(Vs),
   label(Vs).
    </pre>

    The first solution is: 12+83+579=674. On backtracking, <i>all</i>
    solutions are generated. We can easily express further
    constraints. For example, we can generate solutions
    where <tt>T</tt> is <i>not</i>&nbsp;0 by adding the
    constraint&nbsp;<tt>T#\=0</tt>. This yields the solution
    23+74+968=1065.

    <center><h2>Zebra Puzzle</h2></center>

    There is a well-known puzzle commonly known
    as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle"><b>Zebra&nbsp;Puzzle</b></a>.

    <br><br>

    Let us consider the following variant of this famous group of puzzles:

    <br>
    <div class="example">
      <b>Zebra Puzzle</b>: There are <i>five houses</i>, each painted in
      a <i>unique&nbsp;color</i>. Their inhabitants are
      from <i>different</i> nations, own different pets, drink
      different beverages and smoke different brands of cigarettes.

      <ol>
        <li>The Englishman lives in the red house.</li>
        <li>The Spaniard owns the dog.</li>
        <li>Coffee is drunk in the green house.</li>
        <li>The Ukrainian drinks tea.</li>
        <li>From your perspective, the green house is immediately to
        the <i>right</i> of the ivory house.</li>
        <li>The Old Gold smoker owns snails.</li>
        <li>Kools are smoked in the yellow house.</li>
        <li>Milk is drunk in the middle house.</li>
        <li>The Norwegian lives in the first house.</li>
        <li>The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.</li>
        <li>Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.</li>
        <li>The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.</li>
        <li>The Japanese smokes Parliaments.</li>
        <li>The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <i>Who drinks water? Who owns the zebra?</i>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    Such puzzles can be very conveniently solved by first translating
    the entities to <i>integers</i>, and then using your Prolog
    system's <a href="clpfd">declarative integer arithmetic</a> to
    state the given hints as <i>relations</i> between variables whose
    domains are sets of&nbsp;integers. For example, if
    the <i>position</i> of a house is represented as a
    variable <tt>H</tt> with domain {1,2,3,4,5}, then the following
    relation <i>holds</i> for any <i>neighbouring</i>
    house&nbsp;<tt>N</tt>:

    <pre>
abs(H-N) #= 1
    </pre>

    This relation works correctly in <i>all</i> directions, no matter
    which of the two variables, if any, is already instantiated. Thus,
    translating such puzzles to <i>integers</i> often increases
    convenience when expressing the desired relations, and often also
    improves performance due to pruning techniques that are
    automatically&nbsp;applied. In addition, keeping your
    programs <a href="purity">pure</a> lets you benefit from powerful
    additional techniques such as
    <a href="debugging">declarative debugging</a>.

    <br><br>

    Thus, let us consider the following Prolog formulation of
    the&nbsp;task:

    <pre>
solution(Pairs, Water, Zebra, Vs) :-
        Table   = [Houses,Nations,Drinks,Smokes,Animals],
        Houses  = [Red,Green,Yellow,Blue,Ivory],
        Nations = [England,Spain,Ukraine,Norway,Japan],
        Names   = [england,spain,ukraine,norway,japan],
        Drinks  = [Coffee,Milk,OrangeJuice,Tea,Water],
        Smokes  = [OldGold,Kools,Chesterfield,LuckyStrike,Parliaments],
        Animals = [Dog,Snails,Horse,Fox,Zebra],
        pairs_keys_values(Pairs, Nations, Names),
        maplist(all_distinct, Table),
        append(Table, Vs),
        Vs ins 1..5,
        England #= Red,               % hint 1
        Spain #= Dog,                 % hint 2
        Coffee #= Green,              % hint 3
        Ukraine #= Tea,               % hint 4
        Green #= Ivory + 1,           % hint 5
        OldGold #= Snails,            % hint 6
        Kools #= Yellow,              % hint 7
        Milk #= 3,                    % hint 8
        Norway #= 1,                  % hint 9
        next_to(Chesterfield, Fox),   % hint 10
        next_to(Kools, Horse),        % hint 11
        LuckyStrike #= OrangeJuice,   % hint 12
        Japan #= Parliaments,         % hint 13
        next_to(Norway, Blue).        % hint 14

next_to(H, N) :- abs(H-N) #= 1.
    </pre>

    Using <a href="clpfd#labeling">labeling</a>, we obtain the
    puzzle's unique solution:

    <pre>
?- solution(Pairs, Water, Zebra, Vs), label(Vs).
<b>   Pairs = [3-england,4-spain,2-ukraine,1-norway,5-japan],
   Water = 1,
   Zebra = 5,</b>
   Vs = [3,5,1,2,4,3,4,2,1,5,5,3,4,2,1,3,1,2,4,5|...]
;  false.
    </pre>

    Dozens of questions on Stackoverflow are about solving this famous
    puzzle or closely related ones with&nbsp;Prolog. You can thus read
    the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/prolog+zebra-puzzle">existing
    questions and answers</a> for more information.


    <center><h2>Wolf and Goat etc.</h2></center>

    Another group of famous puzzles are known
    as <b>river&nbsp;crossing</b> puzzles. Again, such puzzles can be
    modeled in Prolog in a straight-forward way, by describing the
    different <i>states</i> of all entities, and
    formulating <i>relations</i> between these states. You can use
    Prolog's built-in search strategy to search for a sequence of
    admissible state&nbsp;transitions that let you reach the desired
    target&nbsp;state. Use <i>iterative deepening</i> to find a
    shortest solution. In Prolog, you can easily obtain iterative
    deepening via&nbsp;<tt>length/2</tt>, which creates lists of
    increasing&nbsp;length on backtracking.

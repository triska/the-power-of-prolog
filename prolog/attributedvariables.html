    <center><h1>Attributed Variables in Prolog</h1></center>
    <br><br>

    The most important thing you need to know about <b>attributed
      variables</b> is that Prolog application&nbsp;programmers
      normally <i>need not use them</i>. This chapter is intended
      mainly for Prolog <b>library&nbsp;authors</b> who want to
      improve or implement more declarative language constructs.

    <br><br>

    Attributed variables are a <b>low-level mechanism</b> for
    implementing declarative constructs. However, when considered in
    isolation, they have the potential to prevent and run counter to
    the <a href="reading#declarative"><i>declarative</i>&nbsp;reading</a>
    we want to apply to <a href="purity">pure</a>
    Prolog&nbsp;programs.

    <br><br>

    For this reason, attributed variables should only be used as
    a <i>building&nbsp;block</i>
    for <i>higher-level</i>&nbsp;mechanisms.

    <br><br>

    If you are a Prolog library author, your interest in this topic
    may be warranted. To application programmers, my recommendation is
    to use existing libraries that provide equivalent functionality
    under more declarative&nbsp;wrappers.

    <br><br>

    Prolog implementors may be interested in
    the <a href="#minatotask"><b>Minato&nbsp;task</b></a> and
    in the <a href="#equivalencetask"><b>Equivalence&nbsp;task</b></a> to
    assess the generality of their interface predicates.

    <center><h2>How it started</h2></center>

    Already the first Prolog system, sometimes
    called <i>Prolog&nbsp;0</i>, supported the
    <i>constraint</i>&nbsp;<a href="concepts#builtin"><tt>dif/2</tt></a>.

    <br><br>

    To Prolog implementors and practitioners, the question soon
    became: <i>By which <b>general mechanism</b> can we we implement
      further constraints conveniently, correctly and efficiently</i>?

    <br><br>

    The first mechanism to solve this was proposed by
    <a href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/">Ulrich&nbsp;Neumerkel</a>
    in his
    1990&nbsp;paper <a href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/papers/PDF/meta90.pdf"><i>Extensible
    Unification by Metastructures</i></a>.

    <br><br>

    Here is a salient quote from the paper:

    <blockquote class="quote">
      When considering existing approaches of extensions to syntactic
unification, we observe: highly specialized implementations, where the
unification algorithm cannot be manipulated by the user
(e.g.&nbsp;[Col87,JaLa87,vH89]), approaches too general to be
implemented efficiently and too general to allow the reuse of existing
Prolog programs&nbsp;[Ko84], or extensions allowing definitions in a
procedural language&nbsp;[CLiST89] only.

      <br><br>

      Our approach focuses on a sufficient abstract yet efficient
interface, which permits to write <b>implementations of constraints in
Prolog</b>, neglecting the actual representation of the constrained
variables. Metastructures are applicable, but not restricted to the
      following areas:

      <br><br>
      ...
    </blockquote>

    Among the projected use cases, stream-based side effect free I/O
    is already mentioned in the paper. This is now available
    in <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/Prolog-inedit/sicstus/pio.pl"><tt>library(pio)</tt></a>.


    <center><h2>How it continued</h2></center>

    Christian Holzbaur, who back then was a very close colleague of
    Ulrich&nbsp;Neumerkel, used metastructures in his
    1990&nbsp;dissertation, <i>Specification of Constraint Based
    Inference Mechanism through Extended Unification</i>, in which he
    implemented&nbsp;CLP(Q).


    <br><br>

    After this experience, and having observed some shortcomings of
    metastructures, Holzbaur proposed an alternative yet very strongly
    related mechanism called <b>attributed&nbsp;variables</b>.

    <br><br>

    Holzbaur later published a comparison paper, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.45.3893&rep=rep1&type=pdf"><i>Metastructures vs. Attributed Variables in the Context of Extensible Unification</i></a>.

    <br><br>

    The proposal by Christian Holzbaur was adopted in
    SICStus&nbsp;Prolog, one of the leading&nbsp;systems
    in the area of constraint&nbsp;programming.

    <br><br>

    To quote from the <a href="https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/3.7.1/html/sicstus_17.html"><i>Attributed&nbsp;Variables</i></a> section in the
    SICStus documentation:

    <blockquote class="quote">
This package implements attributed variables. It provides a means of
<i>associating with variables arbitrary attributes</i>, i.e. named properties
that can be used as storage locations as well as to extend the default
unification algorithm when such variables are unified with other terms
or with each other.

<br><br>

This facility was primarily designed as a clean interface between
Prolog and constraint solvers, but has a number of other uses as well.
The basic idea is due to Christian Holzbaur and he was actively
involved in the final design. For background material, see the
dissertation&nbsp;[Holzbaur 90].
    </blockquote>


    If you are interested in more information about the origin of
    these developments, I recommend you ask the involved people
    in&nbsp;person.

    <br><br>

    The same interface is also implemented in other Prolog systems,
    such as&nbsp;<a href="https://ciao-lang.org/">Ciao</a>.

    <center><h2>How it was stymied</h2></center>

    In 2002, Bart Demoen published a highly influential paper
    called <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3104/a69b2ed0bc58d67678c6b91eb3d864fe1de2.pdf"><i>Dynamic
    attributes, their hProlog implementation, and a first
        evaluation</i></a>.

    <br><br>

    Bart Demoen is an extremely prolific and highly regarded member of
    the Prolog community, and several systems therefore adopted the
    approach he proposed.

    <br><br>

    The interface he proposed and implemented deliberately falls short
    in a critical respect. I quote from the paper and highlight the
    key passages:

    <blockquote class="quote">
      <b>4 Basic choice III: no <tt><i>pre_unify</i></tt></b>

      <br><br>

      The most profound difference between attributed variables in
      SICStus Prolog and ECLiPSe is the state of the variable at the
      moment the unifcation handler is called.

      <br><br>

      As an example: assume the attributed variable&nbsp;X has one
      attribute&nbsp;A (with module <tt>user</tt>) and X is unifed
      with the integer&nbsp;666. In SICStus
      Prolog, <a href="https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/3.7.1/html/sicstus_17.html#IDX980"><tt>verify_attributes</tt></a>
      is called with X <b>still being unbound</b>. In ECLiPSe, the
      unify handler is called with A as an argument - <b>X has been
      bound to&nbsp;666 already</b>.

      <br><br>

      The SICStus Prolog behavior follows [6] which claims that <b>it
        is important to have the variables as if not yet bound</b>.


      <br><br>

      ECLiPSe people on the other hand (Joachim Schimpf) claim <b>that
        this is not needed</b>.

      <br><br>

      We do not want to take a stand in this issue: we had implemented
      at some point the full SICStus Prolog behavior (but on dynamic
      attributes of course) and were not convinced that the extra
      implementation complexity was worth the gain. However, we were
      not impressed by the manuals of SICStus Prolog and ECLiPSe,
      which claim that <b>binding the X during a
        <tt>pre_unify</tt> yields unexpected results</b>: in our
      opinion (and experience), it just shows that full support for
      <tt>pre_unify</tt> is too cumbersome to implement and maintain
      in a full system like SICStus Prolog or ECLiPSe. So we
      switched to the ECLiPSe model, but without the compromise to
      support <tt>pre_unify</tt> for compatibility reasons: Occam's
      razor is a blessing&nbsp;:-)
    </blockquote>

    Unfortunately, despite the smiley, the above passage was taken
    seriously by Prolog implementors, and this limited interface is
    what for example SWI-Prolog now provides.


    <center><h2>Occam's razor</h2></center>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's
    razor</a>, in its most popular version, states that <i>"Entities
      are not to be multiplied without necessity"</i>.

    <br><br>

    I ask you, then, <i>why do we have 3 different interfaces for
    attributed variables, two of which are clearly less general than
    the other?</i>

    <br><br>

    A conservative approach, more than 20 years after the work of
    Neumerkel and Holzbaur, could look as follows:

    <br><br>

    Let us consider 4 widely used Prolog systems, such as SICStus,
    GNU-Prolog, ECLiPSe and&nbsp;SWI, and 4 widely used types of
    constraints: <a href="optimization">CLP(H)</a>, <a href="clpfd">CLP(FD)</a>,
    <a href="/clpb/">CLP(B)</a>
    and&nbsp;<a href="https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/3.7.1/html/sicstus_32.html">CLP(Q)</a>.

    <br><br>

    SICStus supports 4 of them. SWI supports 3 of them. ECLiPSe and
    GNU-Prolog support 2 of them. Of these systems, <i>which has the
    most general interface for attributed variables</i>? Take this
    system as the one we want to strive&nbsp;towards. <i>By Occam's
    razor</i>, chances are that they have <i>only done what is
    needed</i> to support the constraint&nbsp;solvers they provide.

    <br><br>

    <center><h2>What we have now</h2></center>

    As we see from the above, the concrete features of attributed
    variables <i>vary between Prolog&nbsp;systems</i>. However, in all
    systems that provide attributed variables, we have essentially the
    following features at our disposal:

    <ol>
      <li>We can <i>attach information</i> to logical variables.</li>
      <li>This information can be taken into account when a variable
        is being <i>unified</i>.</li>
      <li>This information can be <i>displayed in answers</i> on the
        Prolog <a href="concepts#toplevel">toplevel</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    In the following, we consider one specific implementation of these
    features in more detail.

    <center><h2>Attributed variables in SWI-Prolog</h2></center>

    <center><h3>Preliminaries</h3></center>

    To illustrate the key concepts of attributed variables, we
    consider here SWI-Prolog because it is freely available.
    Therefore, you can easily gain experience with its interface for
    attributed&nbsp;variables.

    <br><br>

    I would like to stress again that attributed variables normally
    need&nbsp;not and also <i>should&nbsp;not be&nbsp;used</i> in
    typical Prolog&nbsp;applications. Instead, and also in SWI-Prolog,
    attributed variables are available to implement features
    from <a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=clp"><b>Constraint
    Logic Programming</b></a>, and you should use these higher-level
    predicates instead in typical use&nbsp;cases.

    <br><br>

    When working with attributed variables, you need to know
    3&nbsp;kinds of interface predicates, in accordance with the
    features outlined above:

    <ol>
      <li>Predicates for adding, changing and removing attributes.</li>
      <li>Predicates to reason about the <i>unification</i> of
        variables that have attributes attached.</li>
      <li>Predicates that let you <i>display</i> attributes on the toplevel in some form.</li>
    </ol>

    We now consider these kinds of predicates in turn. For more
    information, see especially
    <a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=attvar">7.1&nbsp;Attributed&nbsp;variables</a>
    in the SWI-Prolog&nbsp;manual. Even though the details differ in
    other Prolog systems, the <i>kinds</i> of predicates are the same
    also in other systems.

    <center><h3>Adding and changing attributes</h3></center>

    In SWI-Prolog, an attributed variable is a <i>relation</i> between
    a&nbsp;<i>variable</i>, a&nbsp;<i>module</i> and a&nbsp;<i>value</i>.

    <br><br>

    Consequently, the predicate for <i>adding</i> and <i>changing</i>
    an attribute has three arguments:

    <br>
    <div id="put_attr" class="predicate">
      <tt><b>put_attr(V, Module, Value)</b></tt>:
      <br>
      Associate an arbitrary Prolog&nbsp;<a href="data#term">term</a>
      <tt>Value</tt> with the logical variable&nbsp;<tt>V</tt> in
      module&nbsp;<tt>Module</tt> (a Prolog&nbsp;<i>atom</i>).
    </div>

    <br>
    We can readily try out this predicate on
    the <a href="concepts#toplevel">toplevel</a>. For example:

    <pre>
?- put_attr(X, m, test).
<b>put_attr(X, m, test).</b>
    </pre>

    We see that in response, the Prolog toplevel simply repeats what
    we said. Thus, the toplevel retains the important invariant
    that <i>the answer is declaratively equivalent to the original
    query</i>. In this concrete case, all there is to say is: The
    value <tt>test</tt> is associated with the
    variable&nbsp;<tt>X</tt> in module&nbsp;<tt>m</tt>, and that's
    exactly what this answer states. We call a variable that has an
    attribute attached an <i>attributed&nbsp;variable</i>.

    <br><br>

    We can attach arbitrary terms to arbitrary variables and modules:

    <pre>
?- put_attr(X, m1, test(Y)), put_attr(Y, m2, test(Z)).
<b>put_attr(X, m1, test(Y)),
put_attr(Y, m2, test(Z)).</b>
    </pre>

    However, in typical cases, you will want to implement
    a <i>single</i> module (such as for
    example <tt><a href="clpfd">clpfd</a></tt>), and the predicates
    you provide will only reason about the attributes
    in <i>that</i> specific&nbsp;module.

    <br><br>

    Importantly, when you use <tt>put_attr/3</tt> <i>repeatedly</i>
    with the same variable and module, then any previously attached
    value is simply <i>overwritten</i>. For example:

    <pre>
?- put_attr(X, m, hi),
   put_attr(X, m, ho).
<b>put_attr(X, m, ho).</b>
    </pre>

    Thus, after these two calls, <b><tt>ho</tt></b> is the single
    remaining value that is attached to <tt>X</tt> in
    module&nbsp;<tt>m</tt>.

    <br><br>

    We say that <tt>put_attr/3</tt> <i>destructively modifies</i> an
    attribute. For this reason, you can use <tt>put_attr/3</tt> also
    as a somewhat more declarative and less error-prone alternative
    to&nbsp;<tt>setarg/3</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Note also that the effect of <tt>put_attr/3</tt> is <i>undone</i>
    on backtracking. For example:

    <pre>
?- ( put_attr(X, m, hello)
   ; true
   ).
<b>put_attr(X, m, hello) ;
true.</b>
    </pre>

    When the alternative is reported, we see from the absence of any
    goals besides&nbsp;<tt>true</tt> that <i>no more attribute</i> is
    attached to&nbsp;<tt>X</tt>. For this reason, assigning attributes
    to variables blends well with Prolog's
    built-in <a href="sorting#searching">search</a>&nbsp;strategy, and
    is similar to <i>unification</i> in that respect. We say that the
    modification is <i>backtrackable</i>.


    <br><br> An additional predicate called <tt>del_attr/2</tt> lets
    you <i>remove</i> an attribute from a variable.

    <center><h3>Unification of attributed variables</h3></center>

    The key distinction between variables and <i>attributed</i>
    variables is what happens at the time of&nbsp;<i>unification</i>.

    <br><br>

    Attributed variables are special in that an <i>extensible</i>
    predicate is <i>automatically&nbsp;invoked</i> when they are
    unified. In SWI-Prolog, the particular predicate that is invoked
    is <tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt> residing in the <i>module</i> where
    the attribute is attached. You, the Prolog&nbsp;programmer, can
    provide a custom <i>definition</i> of this predicate, and it will
    be automatically invoked by the Prolog&nbsp;engine when a variable
    that has attributes attached is being unified.

    <br><br>

    For example, let us define a very rudimentary version
    of <tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt> in module&nbsp;<tt>m</tt>:

    <pre>
m:attr_unify_hook(X, Y) :- throw(cannot_unify(X,Y)).
    </pre>

    With this definition, which simply throws an <i>exception</i> when
    it is invoked, we get for example:


    <pre>
?- put_attr(X, m, a),
   put_attr(Y, m, b),
   <b>X = Y</b>.
<b>ERROR: Unhandled exception: cannot_unify(b,_612)</b>
    </pre>

    From the raised exception, we already see the <i>asymmetry</i> of
    this predicate: Contrary to what you may
    expect, <tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt> is <i>not</i> invoked with the
    arguments of the unification (which are the
    two <i>variables</i> <tt>X</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>Y</tt>), but rather
    with one <i>attribute</i>&nbsp;(namely <tt>b</tt>, which was the
    attribute of&nbsp;<tt>X</tt>), and one
    <i>variable</i>.

    <br><br>

    This happens because the hook is defined as follows:

    <br>
    <div id="attr_unify_hook" class="predicate">
      <tt><b>M:attr_unify_hook(Attr, Value)</b></tt>:
      <br>
      This hook is called <i>after an attributed variable has been
        unified</i> with <tt>Value</tt>, which may be another
      attributed variable. <tt>Attr</tt> is the attribute that was
      associated with the variable in the module&nbsp;<tt>M</tt>,
      and <tt>Value</tt> is the new value of the variable. If this
      predicate fails, the unification fails. If <tt>Value</tt> is
      another attributed variable, the hook often combines the two
      attributes and associates the combined attribute
      with <tt>Value</tt>, using <a href="#put_attr">put_attr/3</a>.
    </div>

    The way in which this predicate works makes it insufficient to
    implement important classes of constraint solvers. We discuss
    this point below. For now, let us make&nbsp;do with what
    we&nbsp;have.

    <br><br>

    First, let us try out what the documentation states: For example,
    let us make the unification&nbsp;<i>fail</i>.

    <pre>
m:attr_unify_hook(_, _) :- <b>false</b>.
    </pre>

    Example query and answer:

    <pre>
?- put_attr(X, m, n(1)),
   put_attr(Y, m, n(2)),
   <b>X = Y</b>.
<b>false.</b>
    </pre>

    OK, this works as advertised. In this example and the following,
    we use
    <a href="data#term">compound&nbsp;terms</a> of the
    form&nbsp;<tt>n(N)</tt> to represent the integer&nbsp;<tt>N</tt>.
    We <i>could</i> also use the integers directly instead. However,
    this would risk ending up with a <a href="data#clean">defaulty</a>
    representation, and also prevent us from symbolically
    distinguishing attributes from logical variables in the code
    below.

    <br><br>

    Second, let us <i>modify</i> the
    involved attributes upon unification. If a unification
    involves <i>two</i> (or more) logical variables, we must
    state how such a unification affects the involved variables.

    <br><br>

    Let us extend the example from above: In the above case, we have
    associated the Prolog terms <tt>n(1)</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>n(2)</tt>
    with the variables <tt>X</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>Y</tt> and
    module&nbsp;<tt>m</tt>. To gather experience with the interface,
    let us say that upon unification of two variables with respective
    attributes <tt>n(A)</tt> and <tt>n(B)</tt>, where <tt>A</tt>
    and <tt>B</tt> are integers, we want to attach the new
    attribute <tt>n(C)</tt> to the resulting (single) variable,
    where <tt>C</tt> is the <i>sum</i> of <tt>A</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>B</tt>.

    <br><br>

    To accomplish this, we need a way to reason about <i>existing</i>
    attributes of variable. The predicate <tt>get_attr/3</tt> is
    available for this purpose:

    <br>
    <div id="get_attr" class="predicate">
      <tt><b>get_attr(V, Module, Value)</b></tt>:
      <br>
      This predicate succeeds <i>if and only if</i> <tt>Value</tt> is
      the attribute of the variable&nbsp;<tt>V</tt> in
      module&nbsp;<tt>Module</tt>.
    </div>
    <br>

    Thus, we shall now implement the following steps:

    <ol>
      <li>Upon unification of two variables with attributes from
        module&nbsp;<tt>m</tt>, <i>fetch</i> these attributes.
      </li>

      <li>Compute the <i>sum</i> of these attributes,
        using <a href="clpfd">integer arithmetic.</a></li>

      <li>Attach the sum as the new attribute to the variable. Note
        that we speak here about <i>the</i> variable because there is
        only a single variable remaining <i>after</i> the unification
        has taken place.</li>
    </ol>

    In Prolog, this becomes:

    <pre>
m:attr_unify_hook(n(A), Var) :-
        get_attr(Var, m, n(B)),      % step (1)
        C #= A + B,                  % step (2)
        put_attr(Var, m, n(C)).      % step (3)
    </pre>

    Note that at the time the hook is invoked, the attribute
    of <i>one</i> of the variables (we do not know which) is already
    available as an <i>argument</i>
    of <a href="#attr_unify_hook"><tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt></a>, so
    we only have to
    use <a href="#get_attr"><tt>get_attr/3</tt></a> <i>once</i>.

    <br><br>

    Now, let us try it out:

    <pre>
?- put_attr(X, m, n(1)),
   put_attr(Y, m, n(2)),
   X = Y.
<b>X = Y,
put_attr(Y, m, n(3)).</b>
    </pre>

    And indeed this works: After the unification, <tt>n(3)</tt> is
    associated with the resulting single variable, which is <tt>X</tt>
    or, <i>equivalently</i>,&nbsp;<tt>Y</tt>, and 3 is the result
    of&nbsp;1+2.

    <br><br>

    The following <i>fails</i>, simply
    because <tt>get_attr/3</tt> <i>fails</i> if its first argument
    is <i>not</i> a variable:

    <pre>
?- put_attr(X, m, n(1)),
   <b>X = a</b>.
<b>false.</b>
    </pre>

    In fact, with the above definition of <tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt>,
    only very specific kinds of unifications will <i>succeed</i>. In
    particular, every unification with a <i>ground</i> value
    will&nbsp;<i>fail</i>. However, in actual constraint&nbsp;systems,
    we are very interested in ground terms, because they typically
    represent concrete <i>solutions</i>.

    <br><br>

    Let us therefore <i>generalize</i> the above definition
    of <tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt> (in module&nbsp;<tt>m</tt>) in such
    a way that it still illustrates a key feature of the whole
    interface, namely the ability to <i>selectively veto
    unifications</i>. For example, in our concrete case, let us allow
    unifications with a concrete <b>integer</b> <i>iff</i> that
    integer matches the associated integer value that is stored in the
    involved variable's attribute.

    <br><br>

    We hence must <i>distinguish</i> two different cases when two
    terms&nbsp;<tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> are unified. Let us consider
    it from the perspective of <tt>X</tt>, i.e., let us suppose
    that <tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt> is invoked with the attribute
    of <tt>X</tt> as the first argument. (Of course, the other case is
    completely symmetric, but we need to draw this distinction to
    discuss the cases.) Then, <i>either</i> <tt>Y</tt> is
    an <i>integer</i>&nbsp;<i>k</i>. In that case, we must <i>veto</i>
    the unification (i.e., fail) if <i>k</i> does not match the
    integer that is stored in the attribute
    of&nbsp;<tt>X</tt>. <i>Or</i> <tt>Y</tt> is an
    attributed <i>variable</i>. In that case, we proceed exactly as
    previously: We compute the <i>sum</i> of the two integers that are
    stored in the attributes of the involved variables, and associate
    that sum with the unified variable.

    <br><br>

    In Prolog, we can express this distinction with the built-in
    predicate <tt>integer/1</tt>:

    <pre>
m:attr_unify_hook(n(A), Other) :-
        (   <b>integer</b>(Other) ->
            Other = A
        ;   get_attr(Other, m, n(B)),
            C #= A + B,
            put_attr(Other, m, n(C))
        ).
    </pre>

    Here are a few sample queries and their results:

    <pre>
?- put_attr(X, m, n(1)), X = 1.
<b>X = 1.</b>

?- put_attr(X, m, n(1)), X = 3.
<b>false.</b>

?- put_attr(X, m, n(1)),
   put_attr(Y, m, n(2)),
   X = Y,
   X = 3.
<b>X = Y, Y = 3.</b>
    </pre>

    Thus, everything seems to work as intended. We have successfully
    created a simplistic <i>constraint&nbsp;solver</i>, which
    admittedly has quite peculiar semantics but implements what we
    have outlined. However, this concrete solver has a very severe
    declarative&nbsp;flaw, which becomes apparent if you eliminate the
    goal <tt>X&nbsp;=&nbsp;Y</tt> in the above conjunction:

    <pre>
?- put_attr(X, m, n(1)),
   put_attr(Y, m, n(2)),
   X = 3.
<b>false.</b>
    </pre>

    In this case, <i>generalizing</i> a query (by <i>removing</i> a
    constraint) has created a
    <i>more&nbsp;specific</i> program (which is now equivalent
    to <tt>false</tt>). This violates elementary properties we expect
    from logic&nbsp;programs and
    prevents for example <a href="debugging">declarative&nbsp;debugging</a>.

    <br><br>

    The key takeaway from this is that <i>the interface for attributed
    variables does not by itself provide any guarantees of the
    resulting constraint&nbsp;solver</i>. You, the programmer, must
    implement your system in such a way that desirable properties are
    preserved in resulting programs. We return to this point below.

    <br><br>

    For now, let us conclude this section with a more interesting and
    also more realistic example: The SWI-Prolog documentation contains
    an example of a simplistic constraint solver
    over <i>finite&nbsp;domains</i>, where the attribute of each
    involved variable (in the module called&nbsp;<tt>domain</tt>) is
    an <i>ordered&nbsp;list</i> of elements, representing the
    admissible <i>domain</i> of the variable.

    <br><br>

    A suitable unification hook for such a constraint solver could
    look like this:

    <pre>
domain:attr_unify_hook(Dom1, Other) :-
        (   <a href="#get_attr">get_attr</a>(Other, domain, Dom2) ->
            ord_intersection(Dom1, Dom2, Dom),
            dif(Dom, []),
            (   Dom = [Value] ->
                Other = Value
            ;   <a href="#put_attr">put_attr</a>(Other, domain, Dom)
            )
        ;   ord_memberchk(Other, Dom1)
        ).
    </pre>

    Informally, we can read this as:

    <ol>
      <li>If <tt>Other</tt> is a variable that has an associated
        domain <tt>Dom2</tt>, then we build
        the <i>intersection</i> <tt>Dom</tt> =
        <tt>Dom1</tt> &cap; <tt>Dom2</tt>. This ordered list contains
        all elements that are admissible for <i>both</i> variables
        that have been unified.
      </li>

      <li>We only proceed if <tt>Dom</tt> is <i>different</i>
        (<tt>dif/2</tt>) from the
        empty <a href="data#list">list</a>&nbsp;<tt>[]</tt>, and
        hence there is at least one remaining domain element
        that is admissible for the resulting unified variable.
      </li>

      <li>If <tt>Dom</tt> has only a single remaining element, then
        that element must be <i>equal&nbsp;to</i> the unified variable
        (because there is no other choice).
      </li>

      <li>Otherwise, assign the intersection <tt>Dom</tt> as
        an <i>attribute</i> to the unified variable.</li>

      <li>If <tt>Other</tt> has no associated domain, then the
        unification is only admissible if <tt>Other</tt> is
        a <i>member</i> of the domain&nbsp;<tt>Dom1.</tt>
      </li>
    </ol>

    In addition, let us use the following definition to associate a
    variable with its domain:

    <pre>
domain(X, List) :-
        list_to_ord_set(List, Dom),
        <a href="#put_attr">put_attr</a>(X, domain, Dom).
    </pre>

    With these definitions in place, we can query:

    <pre>
?- domain(X, [a,b,c]),
   domain(Y, [c,d,e]),
   X = Y.
    </pre>

    In response, we get the concrete solution:

    <pre>
<b>X = Y, Y = c.</b>
    </pre>

    This works because upon unification, the hook is invoked, builds
    the intersection of the two domains, determines that they have
    only a single&nbsp;element in common, and hence unifies the
    resulting variable with that element. Note that <tt>X</tt>
    and <tt>Y</tt> have become completely indistinguishable.
    Unification has truly <i>unified</i> them.

    <br><br>

    <b>Exercise</b> (hard): The following property is highly desirable
      for a constraint solver. Prove that it holds in this case, or
      provide a counterexample:<br><i>For every
      Prolog&nbsp;query&nbsp;<tt>Q</tt> that consists <i>only</i>
      of <tt>domain/2</tt> and <tt>(=)/2</tt> goals, <i>removing</i>
      one of the goals makes the resulting query&nbsp;<tt>Q'</tt> at
      least as general as&nbsp;<tt>Q</tt>, in the sense that the set
      of solutions of <tt>Q</tt> is a subset of those
      of&nbsp;<tt>Q'</tt>.</i>

    <center><h3>Displaying attributes</h3></center>

    In an actual constraint solver, we are not content with answers
    that look like <tt>put_attr(X, m, test)</tt>. Instead, what we
    expect from a constraint solver is a representation of remaining
    attributes that is <i>meaningful to humans</i>. Thus, we expect a
    constraint solver to emit more high-level <i>Prolog&nbsp;goals</i>
    as answers, which have a well-defined meaning no matter how they
    are internally implemented.

    <br><br>

    For this purpose, there is
    the <a href="dcg">DCG&nbsp;nonterminal</a> <tt>M:attribute_goals//1</tt>. In
    SWI-Prolog, you can define this nonterminal in a
    module&nbsp;<tt>M</tt>, and it is automatically invoked by the
    Prolog&nbsp;engine for each variable&nbsp;<tt>X</tt> that has an
    attribute in&nbsp;<tt>M</tt>. It is defined as follows:

    <br>
    <div id="attribute_goals" class="predicate">
      <tt><b>M:attribute_goals(V)</b></tt>:
      <br>
      This is a <a href="dcg">DCG nonterminal</a> describing
      a <i>list</i> of Prolog goals which caused the presence
      of <tt>V</tt>'s attributes in module&nbsp;<tt>M</tt>. This means
      that executing these goals should lead to equivalent attributes
      on&nbsp;<tt>X</tt> in module&nbsp;<tt>M</tt>.
    </div>
    <br>

    For example, let us apply this feature to our simple finite
    domain constraint solver that we considered above. It only has a
    single interface predicate,
    called&nbsp;<tt>domain/2</tt>. Ideally, answers that are reported
    on the toplevel should only use public interface predicates,
    since their meaning is known to&nbsp;users.

    <br><br>

    Thus, it remains for us to <i>translate</i> attributes to
    so-called <i>residual&nbsp;goals</i>, using the above nonterminal.
    In the concrete case above, we can do it like this:

    <pre>
domain:attribute_goals(Var) --&gt;
        { get_attr(Var, domain, Dom) },
        [domain(Var, Dom)].
    </pre>

    This simply fetches the attribute from module <tt>domain</tt>, and
    describes a list with a <i>single</i> goal. Here is an example
    that illustrates that this predicate is automatically invoked by
    the toplevel when reporting answers:

    <pre>
?- domain(X, [a,b,c]).
<b>domain(X, [a, b, c]).</b>
    </pre>

    It also works for more complex queries:

    <pre>
?- domain(X, [a,b,c]),
   domain(Y, [b,c,d]),
   X = Y.
X = Y,
<b>domain(Y, [b, c])</b>.
    </pre>

    Using this mechanism, you can always translate internal attributes
    to Prolog&nbsp;goals that are more meaningful to users.

    <br><br>

    The toplevel provides this functionality by internally invoking
    the predicate&nbsp;<tt>copy_term/3</tt>. This predicate creates
    a <i>copy</i> of variables that may be involved in constraints,
    and uses <tt>attribute_goals//1</tt> to create a <i>list
    of&nbsp;goals</i> that, when called, create equivalent attributes
    on the copy. You can use <tt>copy_term(X, X, Gs)</tt> to reason
    about the constraints&nbsp;<tt>Gs</tt> that <tt>X</tt> is
    involved&nbsp;in. Note that a <i>list</i> of goals is used, since
    this is a <a href="data#clean">clean</a> representation
    of&nbsp;goals that allows convenient further analysis.

    <center><h3>Pitfalls</h3></center>

    Working with attributed variables is <i>extremely</i> error-prone.
    I have considerable experience with such interfaces: I have
    contributed <a href="clpfd">CLP(FD)</a> to SWI-Prolog, and ported
    the whole system to SICStus&nbsp;Prolog
    as <a href="https://github.com/triska/clpz">CLP(Z)</a>. I have
    contributed <a href="/clpb/">CLP(B)</a> to SWI-Prolog, and created
    a <a href="/clpb/clpb.pl">port</a> to SICStus&nbsp;Prolog. I have
    a doctoral degree in the area of constraints: My dissertation is
    called <a href="/drt.pdf"><i>Correctness Considerations in
    CLP(FD)&nbsp;Systems</i></a> and it deals with exactly
    such&nbsp;issues among&nbsp;others. Still, I find
    it <i>extremely</i> hard to work in particular with the SWI-Prolog
    interface.

    <br><br>

    The core shortcoming of the SWI-Prolog interface for attributed
    variables is that <tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt> is only
    invoked <i>after</i> a variable has already been unified.

    <br><br>

    This may seem quite innocent at first: After all, the (previous)
    attribute of that variable is an argument
    of <tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt>, so everything we need to know is
    available, <i>right</i>? Let us suppose that this is the case
    (although it&nbsp;<i>isn't</i>, as we discuss below). Even then,
    several variables may <i>at&nbsp;once</i> become instantiated, for
    example via a goal like <tt>[X,Y]&nbsp;=&nbsp;[0,1]</tt>. It is
    easy to see that if such a unification
    involves <tt>n</tt>&nbsp;variables, then there are at least
    2<sup><i>n</i></sup> different <i>kinds</i> of possible
    instantiation patterns that may arise in a single
    unification. Nobody is able to think all cases through completely.
    An example of a situation that can arise due to simultaneous
    unifications is explained in
    commit&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/commit/9c8ea20b7c9aa5a2b86d4bcc82a93f8f0e7b34c1">9c8ea20b7</a>. A
    highly experienced expert in constraint programming ran into
    the <a href="https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/issues/issues/15">same&nbsp;issue</a>
    in his own constraint solver.

    <br><br>


    But still, maybe the interface is not to blame, right? Maybe we
    have only not tried hard enough to work with the interface. After
    all, only poor craftspeople blame their&nbsp;<i>tools</i>, right?

    <br><br>

    <b>Wrong!</b> If an interface not only makes possible but
    downright <i>enforces</i> such mistakes, then it is time to
    reconsider the interface. Normally, such issues should be reason
    enough to seriously rethink the interface. However, in the Prolog
    community, the error-prone nature of this interface is not by
    itself enough reason for&nbsp;change. Traditionally, it
    is <i>performance</i> that matters&nbsp;most, and who cares about
    correctness as long as your system is&nbsp;fast, <i>right</i>?
    Therefore, I give you a second argument:

    <br><br>

    The SWI-Prolog interface is <i>not&nbsp;sufficient</i> to express
    important classes of constraint solvers. Consider again the
    unification <tt>[X,Y] = [0,1]</tt>. This means that the attributes
    of <i>both</i> variables become unavailable at the same time. It
    is true: When <tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt> is run
    for&nbsp;<tt>X</tt>, you have access to its former attribute. But
    at that time, you can no longer access the former attribute
    of&nbsp;<tt>Y</tt> via <tt>get_attr/3</tt>, and in fact you can
    no&nbsp;longer even tell that <tt>Y</tt> was a variable. The next
    section shows an example where this is needed, but not possible.

    <br><br>

    <center><h2 id="minatotask">Minato task</h2></center>

    Let us now consider a specific task, which is easily encountered
    when implementing a <a href="/clpb/">CLP(B)&nbsp;system</a> based
    on
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-suppressed_decision_diagram">Zero-suppressed
      decision diagrams</a>&nbsp;(ZDDs). ZDDs are a very important
      data&nbsp;structure, and
    <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Donald&nbsp;Knuth</a>
    has called them "the most beautiful construct in
    computer&nbsp;science" in
    a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLBvCB2kr4Q">talk</a>.

    <br><br>

    I call this task <b>Minato&nbsp;task</b>, in honor of
    <a href="http://art.ist.hokudai.ac.jp/~minato/index-j.html">
    湊　真一(みなと　しんいち)</a>, MINATO Shin-ichi, the inventor
    of&nbsp;ZDDs
    (see <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9593/6223362a16a50de2959475d87aefe2a1fec7.pdf"><i>Zero-Suppressed
    BDDs for Set Manipulation in Combinatorial Problems</i></a>). We
    shall use this&nbsp;task to determine whether a Prolog system's
    interface predicates for attributed variables
    are <i>general&nbsp;enough</i> to naturally express a certain
    class of constraints that are of great practical importance.

    <br><br>

    A ZDD is a <i>decision&nbsp;diagram</i>. This means that we can
    simply follow the lines of the diagram to arrive at a
    truth&nbsp;value. The nodes of a&nbsp;ZDD
    are <i>branching&nbsp;variables</i>: If a variable
    is&nbsp;<tt>1</tt>, then we take the <i>plain</i>&nbsp;line, and
    if a variable is&nbsp;<tt>0</tt>, then we take
    the <i>dotted</i>&nbsp;line. In that respect, a ZDD is like
    a <i>Binary Decision Diagram</i>&nbsp;(BDD). However, a ZDD is
    interpreted with the following distinguishing&nbsp;twist: If a
    variable does <i>not</i>&nbsp;appear on a path that leads
    to&nbsp;<b>true</b>, then that variable must be equal
    to&nbsp;<tt>0</tt>.

    <br><br>

    For example, here is a ZDD that represents the truth value
    of the Boolean function <i>X</i>&nbsp;<tt>xor</tt>&nbsp;<i>Y</i>:

    <br><br>

    <center>
      <object data="xor.svg" type="image/svg+xml" style="padding:20pt">
      </object>
    </center>

    We can represent a ZDD as a
    Prolog <a href="data#term">term</a>. The truth
    values <b>true</b> and <b>false</b> can be represented
    as <i>atoms</i>, and an inner node can be represented as
    <tt>(&nbsp;X&nbsp;&rightarrow;&nbsp;Then&nbsp;;&nbsp;Else&nbsp;)</tt>,
    where:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>X</tt> is a <i>branching variable</i></li>
      <li><tt>Then</tt> and <tt>Else</tt> are nodes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    In analogy to Prolog syntax, <tt>Then</tt> is taken to mean
    that <tt>X</tt> is&nbsp;<tt>1</tt> (<b>true</b>), and <tt>Else</tt> means
    that <tt>X</tt> is&nbsp;<tt>0</tt> (<b>false</b>).

    <br><br>

    For example, the ZDD above can be represented as:

    <pre>
( X -&gt; <b>true</b> ; ( Y -&gt; <b>true</b> ; <b>false</b> ) )
    </pre>

    Both variables, <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt>, participate in this
    decision diagram. Therefore, to reason about such constraints in
    Prolog, it is natural to attach this diagram as
    an <i>attribute</i> to both variables. Here is how we can do this
    with <a href="#put_attr">put_attr/3</a>:

    <pre>
?- ZDD = ( X -> true ; ( Y -> true ; false ) ),
   put_attr(X, zdd, ZDD),
   put_attr(Y, zdd, ZDD).
    </pre>

    We now consider a series of unifications, and you tell us how you
    use your system's interface predicates to arrive at the correct
    truth values for <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt>.

    <ol>
      <li>
        As a start, consider the following unification: <tt>X = 0</tt>.

        <br><br>
        You reply for example with: That's easy, I simply take a look at
        the decision diagram, which now is:

    <pre>
( 0 -> true ; ( Y -> true ; false ) )
    </pre>

    Since the first branching variable is now instantiated, it is
    clear which branch we must take, so we can replace the whole diagram with:

    <pre>
( Y -> true ; false )
    </pre>
    From there, further unifications are easy.

    <br><br>

      </li>


      <li>

        Here is a slightly harder case: <tt>X = 1</tt>.

        <br><br>

        This means that the ZDD could be reduced to:

    <pre>
true
    </pre>

    But wait, that's not all! As we explained, a variable that
    does <i>not</i> appear in a path to <b>true</b> must be equal
    to&nbsp;<tt>0</tt>. In this case, <tt>Y</tt> is such a variable,
    so we must set it to&nbsp;<tt>0</tt>. But&nbsp;how? Well, one way
    to do this is to keep track of <i>all&nbsp;variables</i> that have
    so far appeared in constraints, and to represent the ZDD for
    example as a <i>pair</i> of terms, such as:

    <pre>
( X -&gt; true ; ( Y -&gt; true ; false ) )-<b>[X,Y]</b>
    </pre>

    This means that in the above case, we would end up with:

    <pre>
true-[1,Y]
    </pre>

    and from there it is easy to state that <tt>Y&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</tt>.

      </li>


      <li>Here is a third case: <tt>[X,Y]&nbsp;=&nbsp;[1,1]</tt>.

        <br><br>

        And you solve the <b>Minato task</b> by telling us how your
        interface predicates can be used to determine that this
        unification is <i>not&nbsp;admissible</i> due to the
        constraints the variables are involved&nbsp;in.

        <br><br>

        For comparison, the unification must <i>succeed</i> if the ZDD
        is for example:

        <pre>
ZDD = ( X -> Inner ; Inner ), Inner = ( Y -> true ; false )
        </pre>

        This illustrates that you cannot look into <i>other</i>
        branches of the&nbsp;ZDD to recover any information
        about&nbsp;<tt>Y</tt>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    Note especially the following: There is no doubt that this issue
    can be solved <i>somehow</i>, even with a very primitive interface
    for attributed variables. One example would be to duplicate all
    kinds of attributes so that they are available redundantly in all
    data structures that occur anywhere. However, an interface that
    demands such contortions cannot be taken seriously. In
    my&nbsp;view, the key&nbsp;questions are:

    <ul>

      <li>How <i>naturally</i> can an interface be used to solve
        such&nbsp;tasks?</li>

      <li>How likely are <i>mistakes</i> by application programmers
        who use it?</li>

      <li>How hard do we want to make our lives for the sake of
        negligible additional performance?</li>
    </ul>

    In my opinion, we should strive for convenient and <i>general</i>
    interface predicates that make mistakes <i>as unlikely as
    possible</i>. People have suggested that I "want the SICStus
    interface". I would in fact prefer an interface that
    provides <i>even stronger guarantees</i>. However, from those
    interfaces that are currently available, I consider the SICStus
    interface the most desirable, and therefore recommend its
    emulation.

    <center><h3 id="minatotask_sicstus">Solution with SICStus Prolog</h3></center>

    For completeness, here is a possible solution of the
    Minato&nbsp;task, using SICStus&nbsp;Prolog and its very
    general <a href="https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/3.7.1/html/sicstus_17.html#IDX980">interface</a>
    for attributed&nbsp;variables</a>.

    <br><br>

    First, of course, let us use
    a <a href="data#clean"><i>clean</i></a> representation of nodes, such as:

    <ul>
      <li>a <i>leaf</i> is represented as <tt>b(true)</tt> or <tt>b(false)</tt></li>
      <li>an <i>inner node</i> is represented as <tt>( Var -&gt; Then
          ; Else )</tt>, where <tt>Then</tt> and <tt>Else</tt> are nodes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Note in particular that we can now <i>symbolically</i> distinguish
    leaves from inner&nbsp;nodes, thanks to the <tt>b/1</tt> wrapper
    we use for concrete Boolean&nbsp;values.

    <br><br>

    As a warm-up, let us express the so-called <b>restriction</b> of
    a&nbsp;ZDD. This means the relation between one&nbsp;ZDD, and a
    new&nbsp;ZDD that arises when the variable&nbsp;<tt>Var</tt> is
    unified with the concrete Boolean truth value&nbsp;<tt>Value</tt>,
    which is either <tt>0</tt> or&nbsp;<tt>1</tt>:

    <pre>
zdd_restriction(b(T), _, _, b(T)).
zdd_restriction(( Var0 -&gt; Then0 ; Else0), Var, Value, ZDD) :-
        (   Var0 == Var -&gt;
            (   Value =:= 0 -&gt; ZDD = Else0
            ;   Value =:= 1 -&gt; ZDD = Then0
            ;   throw(no_boolean)
            )
        ;   zdd_restriction(Then0, Var, Value, Then),
            zdd_restriction(Else0, Var, Value, Else),
            ZDD = ( Var0 -&gt; Then ; Else )
        ).
    </pre>

    Example query:

    <pre>
?- zdd_restriction((X -> b(true) ; b(false)), X, 1, ZDD).
<b>ZDD = b(true).</b>
    </pre>

    Note that the above method is an extremely inefficient way to
    compute the restriction of a&nbsp;ZDD. Making it faster by
    using <a href="/prolog/memoization"><b>memoization</b></a> is left as an
    exercise.

    <br><br>

        We need a single public predicate to demonstrate how our solution
    works: <tt><b>variables_set_zdd(Vs, ZDD)</b></tt> shall attach the
    given&nbsp;ZDD as an <i>attribute</i> to all variables
    in&nbsp;<tt>Vs</tt>. The attribute shall be of the
    form&nbsp;<tt>zdd_vs(ZDD, Vs)</tt> and store the&nbsp;ZDD as well
    as all variables we want to reason about.

    <br><br>

    In SICStus Prolog, we use <tt>library(atts)</tt> to declare and
    reason about attributes. For example:

    <pre>
:- use_module(library(atts)).

:- attribute zdd_vs/2.

variables_set_zdd(Vs, ZDD) :-
        maplist(set_zdd(ZDD, Vs), Vs).

set_zdd(ZDD, Vs, V) :-
        put_atts(V, +zdd_vs(ZDD, Vs)).
    </pre>

    We are now ready to implement <tt>verify_attributes/3</tt>, which
    is a more general and more declarative form
    of <tt>attr_unify_hook/2</tt>. In SICStus&nbsp;Prolog, this hook
    is invoked <i>before</i> variables with attributes are unified. It
    lets us conveniently reason about all variables. When a ZDD is
    reduced to the leaf&nbsp;node&nbsp;<tt>b(true)</tt>, then all
    variables that were not encountered in that branch must
    be&nbsp;<tt>0</tt>. We enforce this with
    a&nbsp;<a href="dcg">DCG</a> that describes a list of <tt>V=0</tt>
    goals, one for each remaining variable:

    <pre>
verify_attributes(Var, Value, Goals) :-
        (   get_atts(Var, +zdd_vs(ZDD0,Vs)) -&gt;
            (   integer(Value) -&gt;
                zdd_restriction(ZDD0, Var, Value, ZDD)
            ;   throw(aliasing_not_implemented)
            ),
            phrase(remaining_vars_0(ZDD, Var, Vs), Goals)
        ;   Goals = []
        ).

remaining_vars_0(b(true), Var, Vs) --&gt; all_others_0(Vs, Var).
remaining_vars_0((_;_), _, _) --&gt; [].

all_others_0([], _) --&gt; [].
all_others_0([V|Vs], Var) --&gt;
        (   { var(V), V \== Var } -&gt; [V=0]
        ;   []
        ),
        all_others_0(Vs, Var).
    </pre>

    The full code is available from: <a href="minatotask.pl"><tt>minatotask.pl</tt></a>

    <br><br>

    A few sample queries are included. In particular, the
    Minato&nbsp;task works as desired:

    <pre>
?- ZDD = ( X -&gt; b(true) ; ( Y -&gt; b(true) ; b(false) ) ),
   Vs = [X,Y],
   variables_set_zdd(Vs, ZDD),
   Vs = [1,1].
<b>no</b>
    </pre>

    It is clear that the general and declarative SICStus interface has
    some performance impact in comparison with more
    limited&nbsp;hooks. However, in addition to its generality,
    SICStus&nbsp;Prolog is also widely known as one of
    the <i>most&nbsp;efficient</i> Prolog&nbsp;systems.  The argument
    that we should sacrifice correctness for efficiency, even if it
    were a sensible&nbsp;one, can therefore <i>not</i> be applied in
    this case.

    <center><h2 id="equivalencetask">Equivalence task</h2></center>

    We now consider a second task, which I
    call <b>Equivalence&nbsp;task</b>, and which also arises in
    connection with&nbsp;<a href="/clpb/">CLP(B)</a>. I hope this task
    is useful for&nbsp;you to assess the generality and expressiveness
    of your system's interface predicates.

    <br><br>

    The
    <a href="https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/4.3.5/html/sicstus/CLPB-Interface.html#CLPB-Interface">SICStus&nbsp;documentation</a>
    states for <tt>sat(Expression)</tt>, which is
    true <i>iff</i> <tt>Expression</tt> is satisfiable:

    <blockquote class="quote">
      If a variable&nbsp;<tt>X</tt>, occurring in the expression, is
    subsequently unified with some term&nbsp;<tt>T</tt>, this is
    treated as a shorthand for the constraint

<pre>
| ?- sat(X=:=T).
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <br><br>

    To implement this in Prolog, an interface for attributed variables
    must have the ability to reason about a unification <i>before</i>
    it takes&nbsp;place. Again, a different implementation strategy
    necessitates highly unnatural and error-prone encodings.

    <br><br>

    Consider for example the query:

    <pre>
?- sat(X=:=Z), X = X+1.
    </pre>

    and ask yourself how this could be handled in your system.
    According to the SICStus&nbsp;documentation, it should be
    equivalent to:

    <pre>
?- sat(X=:=Z), sat(X=:=X+1).
    </pre>

    This is <i>satisfiable</i> and should therefore yield for example:

    <pre>
<b>X = Z, Z = 1.</b>
    </pre>

    If your system cannot yield such an answer, think about what a
    suitable approximation may look&nbsp;like, and how it can be
    computed.

    <br><br>

    For example, with your interface predicates for attributed
    variables, can you at least somehow <i>distinguish</i> the above
    case from:

    <pre>
?- sat(X=:=Z), X = ~X.
    </pre>

    which ought to be equivalent to:

    <pre>
?- sat(X=:=Z), sat(X =:= ~X).
    </pre>

    and hence <i>fail</i>.

    <center><h2>Further reading and future work</h2></center>

    Attributed variables are typically used to implement constraint
    solvers on top of&nbsp;Prolog. This is their most important, but
    not their <i>only</i> use&nbsp;case.

    <br><br>

    Especially for Prolog programs that need destructive assignments
    or reason about <a href="optimization#graph"><i>graphs</i></a>,
    attributed variables are often a good and convenient
    representation. Do not get carried away with destructive
    assignment though, because it destroys the relational nature of
    your&nbsp;code.

    <br><br>

    A good approach is to <i>encapsulate</i> the use of attributed
    variables behind more declarative interface predicates of
    your&nbsp;libraries. For example, consider the implementation of
    Tarjan's&nbsp;algorithm to find the
    so-called <i>Strongly&nbsp;Connected Components</i> of
    a&nbsp;graph:&nbsp;<a href="/scc.pl"><tt><b>scc.pl</b></tt></a>. In
    that case, the use of attributed variables allows us to implement
    the algorithm with close to asymptotically <i>optimal</i>
    performance.

    <br><br>

    I have described some of the issues in the peer-reviewed
    publication <a href="/swiclpb.pdf"><i><b>The Boolean Constraint Solver of
          SWI-Prolog</b></i></a>. An extended version is in preparation.

    <br><br>

    To me, the current state of interface predicates for
    attributed&nbsp;variables can at best be considered as definitely
    deserving <i>much additional work</i>. For instance, what would be
    the best way to let <i>different</i> constraint
    solvers <i>cooperate</i> in the intersection of their domains?

    <br><br>

    If you have a good idea for new interface predicates, consider
    writing a
    <a href="/acomip/">meta-interpreter</a> that lets you present the
    mechanism to the community by extending an existing
    Prolog&nbsp;system without the need for low-level
    changes. Alternatively, follow the example of Douglas&nbsp;Miles
    and <a href="https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/roadmap/issues/14">extend
    an existing engine directly</a>.

    <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>

    To fully appreciate declarative <b>integer arithmetic</b>
    in&nbsp;Prolog, let us first consider arithmetic
    over <i>natural&nbsp;numbers</i> as a simpler special&nbsp;case.

    <br><br>

    The <b>natural numbers</b> are defined by
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Peano&nbsp;axioms</a>.
    In particular, <b>0</b> is a natural&nbsp;number, and for every
    natural number&nbsp;<i>n</i>,
    its <i>successor</i>&nbsp;<i>S(n)</i> is <i>also</i> a
    natural&nbsp;number. Thus, we <i>could</i> use the following
    Prolog program to define the set of natural&nbsp;numbers:

    <pre>
natnum(0).
natnum(s(N)) :-
        natnum(N).
    </pre>

    In this representation, the natural number <b>0</b> is represented
    by the Prolog&nbsp;integer&nbsp;<tt>0</tt>, and
    the <i>successor</i> of any natural number&nbsp;<tt>N</tt> is
    represented by the
    compound <a href="data#term">term</a>&nbsp;<tt>s(N)</tt>. For
    example, the integer&nbsp;2 is represented as <tt>s(s(0))</tt>,
    since it is the successor of the successor of&nbsp;zero.  This
    representation is variously
    called <b>successor&nbsp;arithmetic</b>, <b>successor notation</b>
    and also <b>Peano&nbsp;arithmetic</b>.

    <br><br>

    With this representation, we <i>could</i> use the following
    Prolog&nbsp;program to define <i>addition</i>, which is
    a <i>relation</i> between two natural numbers and
    their&nbsp;<i>sum</i>:

    <div class="box" style="float: right; width: 50%">
      <b>Exercise</b>: Suppose I replace the goal <tt>nat_nat_sum(M,
      N, Sum)</tt> by <tt>nat_nat_sum(N, M, Sum).</tt> What are the
      advantages, and what are the drawbacks of this change, if any?
    </div>

    <pre>
nat_nat_sum(0, M, M).
nat_nat_sum(s(N), M, s(Sum)) :-
        nat_nat_sum(M, N, Sum).
    </pre>

    This is a <a href="purity">pure</a> predicate
    that <i>terminates</i> if any of the arguments is instantiated. We
    can read the
    clauses <a href="reading#declarative">declaratively</a> to reason
    about the cases that this relation describes. Other elementary
    relations between natural numbers can be defined analogously.

    <br><br>

    Unfortunately, this representation of natural&nbsp;numbers suffers
    from several significant disadvantages:

    <ul>
      <li>First, this is not really the way we <i>want</i> to write
        and read numbers. We would like to use a more familiar
        notation&mdash;such as 1, 2 and&nbsp;3&mdash;to represent
        natural&nbsp;numbers.</li>
      <li>With some practice, we may get used to the
        successor&nbsp;notation. However, a more fundamental problem
        remains: This representation takes space that is directly
        proportional to the <i>magnitude</i> of the numbers we
        need&nbsp;to represent. Thus, the space requirement
        grows <i>exponentially</i> with the length of any number's
        decimal representation. Therefore, reasoning about larger
        numbers is infeasible with this representation.
        </li>
      <li>More complex relations such as <i>multiplication</i>
        and <i>exponentiation</i> are hard to define in such a way
        that they work in <i>all</i> directions and retain good
        termination&nbsp;properties.</li>
      <li>To extend this representation to <i>integers</i>, we also
        need a way to represent <i>negative</i>&nbsp;numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    Therefore, successor notation&mdash;albeit useful to illustrate
    different ways in which we <i>could</i> represent
    our&nbsp;data&mdash;is&nbsp;<i>not</i> how we typically reason
    about numbers in&nbsp;Prolog.

    <br><br>

    Instead, we use
    <a href="concepts#builtin">built-in&nbsp;predicates</a> to reason
    about <i>numbers</i> in Prolog. In the case of <b>integers</b>,
    these predicates are known as <b>CLP(FD)&nbsp;constraints</b>.
    CLP(FD) stands for <i>Constraint Logic Programming</i>
    over <i>Finite&nbsp;Domains</i> and reminds us of the fact that in
    reality, we can only represent a <i>finite</i> subset of integers
    on actual&nbsp;machines.

    <br><br>

    All widely used Prolog implementations provide
    CLP(FD)&nbsp;constraints. However, the exact details differ
    slightly between various systems. For example, in GNU&nbsp;Prolog,
    B-Prolog and other systems, CLP(FD) constraints are conveniently
    available right from the start. In contrast, you need to load
    a <i>library</i> to use&nbsp;them in SICStus&nbsp;Prolog and
    other&nbsp;systems.

    <br><br>

    If your Prolog systems provides CLP(FD) constraints as a library,
    adjust your initialization file so that this library is
    automatically available in all your programs. For example, in
    SICStus Prolog, you can put the following directive in your
    initialization file:

    <div>
      <pre class="box">
:- use_module(library(clpfd)).</pre>
    </div>

    For SICStus Prolog, also consider
    using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/triska/clpz"><b>CLP(&#x2124;)</b></a>,
    which is a generalization of&nbsp;CLP(FD).

    <br><br>

    It is highly advisable to make CLP(FD) or CLP(&#x2124;) constraints
    automatically available in all your programs, since almost all
    Prolog programs also reason about&nbsp;integers.

    <br><br>

    </table>

    <center><h2 id="constraint">Constraints</h2></center>

    Generally, an <i>n</i>-ary <b>constraint</b> is a <i>relation</i>
    between <i>n</i>&nbsp;variables. For example, <tt>(=)/2</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>dif/2</tt> fit this definition: These predicates
    are <i>also</i> constraints! In fact, <i>every</i> predicate you
    impose can be regarded as a&nbsp;<i>constraint</i> on the set
    of&nbsp;solutions.

    <br><br>

    In the following, we are considering CLP(FD)&nbsp;constraints.
    These are built-in predicates that enable reasoning
    over <i>integers</i> in a pure and declarative&nbsp;way.

    <br><br>

    The most important CLP(FD) constraints are the <i>arithmetic</i>
    constraints <tt>(#=)/2</tt>, <tt>(#&lt;)/2</tt>, <tt>(#&gt;)/2</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>(#\=)/2</tt>:

    <center>
      <table style="padding: 10pt">
        <tr>
          <td width="20%"><b>Constraint</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
          <td><center><b>Meaning</b></center></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><hr></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>A #= B</pre>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i><tt>A</tt> is <i>equal to</i> <tt>B</tt></i>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>A #&lt; B</pre>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i><tt>A</tt> is <i>less than</i> <tt>B</tt></i>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>A #&gt; B</pre>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i><tt>A</tt> is <i>greater than</i> <tt>B</tt></i>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>A #\= B</pre>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i><tt>A</tt> is <i>not equal to</i> <tt>B</tt></i>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>

    In this table, <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> are
    arithmetic <i>expressions</i>. Expressions are
    defined <i>inductively</i>:

    <ul>
      <li>a <i>variable</i> is an expression</li>
      <li>an <i>integer</i> is an expression</li>
      <li><i>if</i> <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> are
        expressions, <i>then</i> <tt>X+Y</tt>, <tt>X-Y</tt>
        and&nbsp;<tt>X*Y</tt> are <i>also</i> expressions.</li>
    </ul>


    There are several more cases of arithmetic expressions, and also
    other categories of constraints, such as <i>combinatorial</i>
    constraints. See your Prolog&nbsp;system's manual for more
    information.

    <br><br>
    <center><h2>Evaluating integer expressions</h2></center>

    The most basic use of CLP(FD) constraints is <b>evaluation</b> of
    arithmetic expressions.

    <br><br>

    To evaluate integer expressions, we use the
    predicate <tt>(#=)/2</tt> to denote <b>equality</b> of arithmetic
    expressions over integers.

    <br><br>

    Here are a few examples:

    <pre>
?- X #= 5 + 3.
X = 8.

?- 2 #= X + 9.
X = -7.

?- 1 #= 1 + Y.
Y = 0.
    </pre>

    Equality is one of the most important predicates when reasoning
    about integers. As these examples illustrate, <tt>(#=)/2</tt> is a
    <a href="purity">pure</a> relation that can be used in all
    directions, also of components of its arguments are still variables.

    <center><h2 id="list_length">Example: Length of a list</h2></center>

    For example, we can readily relate
    a&nbsp;<a href="data#list">list</a> to its&nbsp;<i>length</i> as follows:

    <pre>
list_length([], 0).
list_length([_|Ls], Length) :-
        Length #= Length0 + 1,
        list_length(Ls, Length0).
    </pre>

    A <a href="reading#declarative">declarative reading</a> of this
    predicate makes clear what this relation means:

    <ul>
      
      <li>The length of the <i>empty&nbsp;list</i> is&nbsp;0.</li>
      <li><i>If</i> <tt>Length0</tt> is the length
        of&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt> <i>and</i> <tt>Length</tt>
        is <tt>Length0</tt> plus&nbsp;1, <i>then</i> the length
        of&nbsp;<tt>[_|Ls]</tt> is&nbsp;<tt>Length</tt>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Example query:

    <pre>
?- list_length([a,b,c,d], Length).
<b>Length = 4</b>.
    </pre>

    Importantly, this also works in more general cases. For example:

    <pre>
?- list_length(Ls, Length).
<b>Ls = [],
Length = 0 ;
Ls = [_1716],
Length = 1 ;
Ls = [_42, _150],
Length = 2</b> .
    </pre>

    It can also be used in a different direction. For example:

    <pre>
?- list_length(Ls, 3).
<b>Ls = [_898, _1064, _1230]</b> .
    </pre>

    Note though that this does not terminate:

    <pre>
?- list_length(Ls, 3), <b>false</b>.
<b>nontermination</b>
    </pre>

    It takes only a single additional goal to make this
    query <i>terminate</i>. This is left as an exercise.

    <br><br>

    To avoid the accumulation of <i>constraints</i>, we can introduce
    an explicit <i>accumulator</i>. By this, we mean a term that
    represents intermediate states that arise. For example, here is
    an <i>alternative</i> solution for relating a list to
    its&nbsp;length:

    <pre>
list_length(Ls, L) :-
        list_length_(Ls, 0, L).

list_length_([], L, L).
list_length_([_|Ls], L0, L) :-
        L1 #= L0 + 1,
        list_length_(Ls, L1, L).
    </pre>

    Again, making the goal <tt>list_length(Ls, 3)</tt> <i>terminate</i> is left as an exercise.
    <center><h2 id="domain">Domains</h2></center>

    We can reason even more generally over integers. Consider a
    variable&nbsp;<tt>V</tt> that we want to use as a
    placeholder for an integer between 0 and&nbsp;2. We express this
    on the toplevel using the constraint&nbsp;<tt>(in)/2</tt>:

    <pre>
?- V in 0..2.
V in 0..2.
    </pre>


    If we place additional goals on the toplevel, the system
    automatically takes into account the admissible set of integers we
    specified for&nbsp;<tt>V</tt>, which we call its associated
    <b>domain</b>. In particular, the system prevents us from unifying
    <tt>V</tt> with integers that are not elements of its domain:

    <pre>
?- V in 0..2, V #= 3.
<b>false.</b>
    </pre>

    In contrast, the following query succeeds:

    <pre>
?- V in 0..2, V #= 1.
<b>V = 1.</b>
    </pre>

    Now two variables <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt>, both constrained to
    the interval&nbsp;0..2:

    <pre>
?- X in 0..2, Y in 0..2.
X in 0..2,
Y in 0..2.
    </pre>

    Or, equivalently:

    <pre>
?- [X,Y] ins 0..2.
X in 0..2,
Y in 0..2.
    </pre>

    Thus, the predicate <tt>(ins)/2</tt> lifts <tt>(in)/2</tt>
    to <i>lists</i> of variables.


    <center><h2 id="labeling">Labeling</h2></center>

    We can successively bind a variable to all integers of its
    associated domain via backtracking, using the <i>enumeration</i>
    predicate&nbsp;<tt>indomain/1</tt>:

    <pre>
?- V in 0..2, indomain(V).
V = 0 ;
V = 1 ;
V = 2.
    </pre>


    Assigning concrete values to constrained variables is called
    <b>labeling</b>. The predicate&nbsp;<tt>label/1</tt>
    lifts <tt>indomain/1</tt> to <i>lists</i> of variables:

    <pre>
?- [X,Y] ins 0..1, label([X,Y]).
X = Y, Y = 0 ;
X = 0, Y = 1 ;
X = 1, Y = 0 ;
X = Y, Y = 1.
    </pre>

    If <tt>label/1</tt> were not available, you could define it like this:

    <pre>
label(Vs) :- <a href="metapredicates#maplist">maplist</a>(indomain, Vs).
    </pre>


    Labeling is a form of <a href="sorting#searching">search</a>
    that <i>always&nbsp;terminates</i>. This property is of extreme
    importance for termination analysis and allows us to cleanly
    separate the modeling part from the actual search.

    <br><br>


    In practice, the order in which variables are bound to concrete
    values of their domains matters. For this reason, the
    predicate <tt>labeling/2</tt>, which is a <i>generalization</i>
    of <tt>label/1</tt>, lets you specify different <b>strategies</b>
    when enumerating admissible values. A simple and often very
    effective heuristics is to always label that variable next whose
    domain contains the <i>smallest</i> number of elements. This
    strategy is called "first-fail", since these variables are often
    most likely to cause failure of the labeling process, and trying
    them early can prune huge portions of the search tree. It is
    available via <tt>labeling([ff], Vars)</tt>.

    <br><br>

    For other problems, a static reordering of variables may suffice.
    With <a href="/queens/">N-queens</a> for example, it is worth
    trying to order the variables so that labeling starts from the
    board's center and gradually moves to the borders.

    <center><h2 id="propagation">Constraint propagation</h2></center>

    From what we have seen above, it follows that we
    can <i>combine</i> different constraints by stating them as
    a&nbsp;<i>conjunction</i>. For instance, we can state
    that <tt>Z</tt> is the sum of <tt>X</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>Y</tt>, both
    of which are integers between 0 and&nbsp;2:

    <pre>
?- [X,Y] ins 0..2, Z #= X + Y.
X in 0..2,
X+Y#=Z,
Y in 0..2,
<b>Z in 0..4.</b>
    </pre>

    Note that the domain of <tt>Z</tt> is <i>deduced</i> from the
    posted constraints without being stated explicitly. Narrowing
    domains based on posted constraints is called
    (constraint) <b>propagation</b>, and it is performed automatically
    by the constraint&nbsp;solver. If we bind
    <tt>Z</tt> to&nbsp;0, the system deduces that both <tt>X</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>Y</tt> are also&nbsp;0:

    <pre>
?- [X,Y] ins 0..2, Z #= X + Y, Z #= 0.
X = 0,
Y = 0,
Z = 0.
    </pre>

    In this case, propagation yields ground instances for all
    variables. In other cases, constraint propagation detects
    unsatisfiability of a set of constraints without any labeling:

    <pre>
?- X in 0..1, X #&gt; 2.
<b>false.</b>
    </pre>

    In yet other cases, domain boundaries are adjusted:

    <pre>
?- [X,Y] ins 0..2, Z #= X + Y, Z #= 1.
<b>Z = 1,
X in 0..1,</b>
X+Y#=1,
<b>Y in 0..1.</b>
    </pre>

    A set of constraints and variables with associated domains is
    called (globally) <b>consistent</b> if all variables can be
    simultaneously bound to (at least) one value of their respective
    domains such that all constraints are satisfied. In general, all
    variables must be <i>labeled</i> to find out whether a set of
    constraints is consistent. However, there exist weaker forms of
    consistency that are guaranteed without labeling.

    <br><br>

    For example, the <tt>all_different/1</tt> constraint does not
    detect unsatisfiability of the following:

    <pre>
?- [X,Y,Z] ins 0..1, all_different([X,Y,Z]).
X in 0..1,
all_different([X, Y, Z]),
Y in 0..1,
Z in 0..1.
    </pre>

    The <tt>all_distinct/1</tt> constraint, in contrast, detects the
    inconsistency without labeling any variables:

    <pre>
?- [X,Y,Z] ins 0..1, all_distinct([X,Y,Z]).
<b>false.</b>
    </pre>

    To guarantee that stronger form of consistency, the
    <tt>all_distinct/1</tt> constraint must do extra work for
    propagation. It therefore depends on the problem at hand whether
    it pays off to use it instead of <tt>all_different/1</tt>. If
    there are many solutions distributed throughout the whole
    search&nbsp;space, a naive search for solutions may easily find
    them, and additional pruning may only make this&nbsp;process
    slower. On the other hand, if solutions are relatively sparse, the
    additional pruning of <tt>all_distinct/1</tt> can&nbsp;help to
    more effectively prune irrelevant parts of the search&nbsp;space.
    In practice, <tt>all_distinct/1</tt> is
    typically <i>fast&nbsp;enough</i> and is preferable due to its
    much stronger&nbsp;propagation.

    <br><br><br>
    <center><h2>Legacy predicates</h2></center>

    CLP(FD) constraints have been available only for a
    few&nbsp;decades. This means that they are still
    a <i>comparatively</i> recent development in Prolog systems. Most
    available textbooks have not yet had a chance to take such
    innovations into account. Many Prolog&nbsp;instructors have
    completed their formal education before constraints have become
    widely available. As a result, many Prolog programmers have never
    even heard of&nbsp;constraints.

    <br><br>

    Instead of arithmetic constraints like&nbsp;<tt>(#=)/2</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>(#&gt;)/2</tt>, you can also use lower-level
    arithmetic predicates like&nbsp;<tt>(is)/2</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>(>)/2</tt> to reason about integers. However, this
    comes with several hefty drawbacks. For example:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>(is)/2</tt> and other low-level predicates
      are <i>moded</i>. This means that they can only be used in a
      few&nbsp;directions, making them unsuitable for more
      general&nbsp;relations. This severe limitation also
      prevents <a href="debugging"><i>declarative&nbsp;debugging</i></a>.
      </li>

      <li><tt>(is)/2</tt> and other low-level predicates intermingle
      reasoning about integers with reasoning about floating point
      numbers, and in some systems even
      about <i>rational</i>&nbsp;numbers. This means that when readers
      of your code see such predicates, they will wonder whether you
      are using&nbsp;them because floating point&nbsp;numbers may
      arise somewhere. In contrast, <tt>(#=)/2</tt> and other CLP(FD)
      constraints make it perfectly clear that you intend to reason
      about&nbsp;<i>integers</i>. These constraints will help you to
      find certain classes of mistakes in your code more easily,
      because they throw <i>type&nbsp;errors</i> instead of failing
        silently.</li>

      <li><tt>(is)/2</tt> and other low-level predicates force
        beginners to understand the procedural execution of
        Prolog&nbsp;programs <i>in addition</i> to understanding the
        declarative&nbsp;semantics. This is too&nbsp;hard in almost
        all&nbsp;cases.</li>
      
      <li><tt>(is)/2</tt> itself is not sufficient: You also
        need <tt>(=:=)/2</tt>. In contrast, the CLP(FD)
        constraint&nbsp;<tt>(#=)/2</tt>
        subsumes <i>both</i> <tt>(is)/2</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>(=:=)/2</tt>
        when reasoning over integers, making Prolog easier to&nbsp;teach.</li>
    </ul>

    For these reasons, I regard <tt>(is)/2</tt>, <tt>(>)/2</tt> and
    other low-level predicates as <i>legacy&nbsp;predicates</i>. I
    expect them to gradually&nbsp;disappear from application&nbsp;code
    when the current generation of Prolog instructors is replaced, and

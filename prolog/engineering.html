    <center><h2>Prolog Development Environment</h2></center>

    There are several good <i>development environments</i> with
    special support for Prolog&nbsp;coding.

    <br><br>

    For example, see <a href="/pceprolog/">PceProlog</a> to
    configure <b>GNU&nbsp;Emacs</b> for Prolog.

    <br><br>

    The <tt>comp.lang.prolog</tt> <a href="/prolog/faq/">FAQ</a>
    contain pointers to several additional environments.

    <br><br>

    Prolog systems ship with different features that
    make <i>compiling</i> and <i>consulting</i> your code easier. For
    example, in SWI-Prolog, you can invoke the built-in
    predicate <tt>make/0</tt> to reconsult all source files. This
    feature works to various degrees, depending on other features you
    are using. Using <a href="/ediprolog/">ediprolog</a>, you can stay
    in the Emacs&nbsp;buffer, and interact with Prolog directly in the
    buffer.

    <br><br>

    I recommend you use the system that works best for you, i.e., I
    recommend you use&nbsp;Emacs for Prolog development. Make sure to
    configure your keyboard so that you can
    use <tt>Caps&nbsp;Lock</tt> as an
    additional <tt>Ctrl</tt>&nbsp;key! In my experience, Emacs is most
    usable with a <i>Dvorak</i> keyboard layout.

    <center><h2>Module Systems</h2></center>


    For programming <i>in the large</i>, and even for
    programming <i>in the medium</i>, and <i>even</i> for several
    other kinds of programming, you will want to make use of your
    Prolog's <i>module&nbsp;system</i> to separate logical&nbsp;units
    of&nbsp;code.

    <br><br>

    Different Prolog implementations support different <i>kinds</i> of
    module systems. Notably, there are <i>functor-based</i> module
    systems and <i>predicate-based</i> module systems, with different
    consequences and trade-offs. It is very hard to <i>design</i> a
    module system and think all consequences through. Usually,
    conflicting requirements are imposed on a module system: On the
    one hand, you want to use modules
    to <i>separate&nbsp;concerns</i>, and on the other hand, you want
    to support <i>code&nbsp;introspection</i> and other features that
    run counter to true separation. Therefore, typical module systems
    are ultimately inconsistent, yet useful for structuring your
    source files and avoiding name&nbsp;conflicts.

    <br><br>

    <i>Using</i> a particular module system is usually very
    straight-forward. Essentially, you typically place
    a <tt>module/2</tt> (or similar) directive in your source file,
    such as:

    <pre>
:- module(my_nice_module, [first_exported_predicate/2,
                           second_exported_predicate/1,
                           third_exported_predicate/4,
                           ...
                          ]).
    </pre>

    where the various <i>exported</i> predicates are listed by their
    predicate <i>indicators</i> (name and arity). In Prolog&nbsp;files
    that <i>use</i> a module, you place a
    corresponding <tt>use_module/1</tt> (or similar) directive, such
    as:

    <pre>
:- use_module(my_nice_module).
    </pre>

    A major advantage is that the <i>internal</i> predicates
    of <tt>my_nice_module</tt> cannot cause conflicts with internal
    predicates of other programs and modules.

    <center><h2>Timing and Profiling</h2></center>

    Different Prolog systems provide different ways to <i>time</i>
    and <i>profile</i> your&nbsp;predicates. For example, in
    SWI-Prolog, you can use the built-in predicate <tt>time/1</tt> to
    measure the run&nbsp;time of any goal. For example:

    <pre>
?- <b>time</b>((X in 0..100 000,indomain(X),false)).
% 6,700,137 inferences, <b>0.362 CPU in 0.389 seconds</b> (93% CPU, 18485129 Lips)
false.
    </pre>

    SWI-Prolog also ships with a very nice <i>profiler</i> which you
    can invoke via <tt>profile/1</tt>. Simply supply the goal you want
    to profile as an argument. Other systems such as
    SICStus&nbsp;Prolog also ship with a
    built-in <a href="https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/4.3.2/html/sicstus/Execution-Profiling.html">profiler</a>.

    <br><br>

    Most Prolog systems provide the predicate <tt>statistics/2</tt>
    which you can use to take your own measurements. For example, we
    can define the <i>relation</i> between a goal and the
    CPU&nbsp;time it takes until it succeeds:

    <pre>
goal_time(Goal, T) :-
        statistics(runtime, [T0|_]),
        Goal,
        statistics(runtime, [T1|_]),
        T #= T1 - T0.
    </pre>

    We can now obtain the CPU&nbsp;time (in milliseconds) of any
    goal&nbsp;<tt>Goal</tt> via the query:

    <pre>
?- goal_time(Goal, Time).
    </pre>

    I highly recommend such tools to measure the performance of your predicates.


    <center><h2 id="errors">Exceptions and Errors</h2></center>

    Prolog supports raising and handling <i>exceptions</i>. As the
    name implies, this mechanism is useful to
    handle <i>exceptional</i> situations. Some of these situations are
    already prescribed in the ISO&nbsp;standard. The most important
    ones are:

    <ul>
      <li><b>type&nbsp;error</b>: This exception is raised when a
        particular <i>type</i> of term is expected, but a different
        kind of term is present. The ISO&nbsp;standard explicitly
        defines sets of terms (such as <i>integer</i>, <i>list</i>
        etc.) for which a type&nbsp;error may be raised.</li>

      <li><b>domain&nbsp;error</b>: This is very similar to a type
        error: A different <i>kind</i> of term than is present is
        expected. The difference to a type error is that the kind of
        term that is expected is <i>not</i> among the predefined types
        that are defined in the standard.</li>

      <li><b>instantiation&nbsp;error</b>: This exception is raised
        when a predicate argument is
        insufficiently <i>instantiated</i>, i.e., a <i>variable</i>
        occurs where a more specific term is expected.
      </li>
    </ul>

    There is a very important semantic difference between these
    exceptions: Declaratively, a <i>type</i> or <i>domain</i> error
    can be replaced by silent <i>failure</i>, because no further
    constraint you add to the (monotonic) program can turn such a
    situation into success. On the other hand,
    an <i>instantiation</i>&nbsp;error <i>must&nbsp;not</i> be
    replaced by silent failure, because there <i>could</i> still be
    solutions in such cases, and adding further constraints may
    reveal&nbsp;them.

    <br><br>

    Here are two examples that illustrate these cases:

    <pre>
?- X #= a.
ERROR: <b>Domain error</b>: `clpfd_expression' expected, found `a'

?- X in Y.
ERROR: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated
    </pre>

    It is easy to see that adding further constraints can make
    the <i>second</i> query succeed:

    <pre>
?- <b>Y = 0..5</b>, X in Y.
Y = 0..5,
X in 0..5.
    </pre>

    However, no additional goal can ever
    make <tt>X&nbsp;#=&nbsp;a</tt> succeed, and therefore
    this <i>domain&nbsp;error</i> could also be replaced by failure.

    <br><br>

    In exceptional situations, exceptions are typically more useful
    than silent failure, because they let you reason about
    the <i>cause</i> of the problem.

    <br><br>

    You can use the standard&nbsp;predicate <tt>throw/1</tt>
    to <i>raise</i> an exception, and the standard
    predicate <tt>catch/3</tt> to handle exceptions.

    <center><h2>Unit Tests</h2></center>

    <i>Unit tests</i> are an extremely important tool to detect
    regressions in your code.

    <br><br>

    Prolog is eminently well-suited to formulate and run unit tests.
    Using declarative descriptions and Prolog's built-in backtracking
    mechanism, you can quickly formulate tests that cover a vast range
    of possible tests. Essentially, state what <i>ought</i> to hold,
    and then simply <i>run</i> these queries to test whether
    it <i>does</i> hold.

    <br><br>

    There is a unit testing framework
    called <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section(%27packages/plunit.html%27)">PlUnit</a>
    that is available for SWI-Prolog <i>and</i> for SICStus&nbsp;Prolog.
